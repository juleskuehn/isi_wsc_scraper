Besides few exceptions made, formally governments do not usually collaborate with the private sector, civil society or even academia in statistical operations. In fact citizen science is mostly an under explored discipline in the official decision-taking processes. However, the 2030 Agenda boosted by the United Nations, advocates for a constructive convergence in the data quest and calls for untapped data partnerships to support the measurement of the Sustainable Development Goals. This session will portray new methodologies for strengthening capacity building in National Statistical Offices (NSOs) for nationwide challenges like the monitoring of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The angle that the session will discuss is the institutional void of direct citizen involvement in the SDG quest, identifying potentialities and limitations of civil society collaborating with governments to boost assistance from citizen science for the SDGs.   The post-2015 Development Agenda has highlighted the need for partnerships between diverse stakeholders. Besides few exception made, formally governments do not usually collaborate with private sector, civil society or even academia in statistical operations. In fact citizen science is mostly an unexplored discipline in the official decision taking processes. Evidence shows that actors have different tensions and incentives towards data. However, the 2030 Agenda boosted from the United Nations, advocates for a constructive convergence in the data quest and calls for untapped data partnerships to support the measurement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
The proposed session will portray and discuss new methodologies for strengthening capacity building in National Statistical Offices (NSOs) for nationwide challenges like the multilevel Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting operations. The angle of analysing this institutional void is to understand why and how governments reveal they are not opening to receive assistance from citizen science. 
The session aims to profile new types of working arrangements, e.g. data partnerships between governments and third parties, which among other includes the integration of administrative registries, co-produced surveys, and crowdsourcing data from untapped sources for official statistics such as civil society or academia. In particular, the storyline will describe and draw vital lessons from the portrayed experiences of citizen-rooted non-governmental organisation that have essayed solutions in the form of data partnerships.   Organiser: Prof. Javier Andres Carranza Torres  Chair: Dr Stephen MacFeely  Speaker: Prof. Javier Andres Carranza Torres  Speaker: Mrs Yongyi Min  Discussant: Frederico Segui Discussant: Dr Ola Awad-Shakhshir",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/334/details/

                 Mr Jelmer C. de Groot ","For many, the very first encounter with a particular survey organisation happens upon reading a letter inviting them to take part in a survey – and first impressions matter the most. Therefore, good advance letter design is paramount in motivating people to cooperate and reducing survey nonresponse (Groves & Couper 1998, Dillman et al. 2014, etc.). A large body of literature informs on their usefulness in mail surveys (e.g. Levine & Gordon 1958, Kephart & Bressler 1958, Ford 1967, Parsons & Medford 1972, Eisinger et al. 1974, Kanuk & Berenson 1975, Fox et al. 1988, Yammarino et al. 1991, Nicolaas et al. 2015, etc.), face-to-face surveys (e.g. Luppes 1995, Groves & Couper 1998, White et al. 1998, van den Brakel 2008, Wedemann & Farnall 2014, etc.), telephone surveys (e.g. Dillman et al. 1976, Traugott et al. 1987, Singer et al. 2000, Hembroff et al. 2005, Link & Mokdad 2005, De Leeuw et al. 2007, etc.), web surveys (e-mails and/or/vs. postal mails, e.g. Crawford et al. 2001, Goldstein & Jennings 2002, Bosnjak et al. 2007, Couper 2008, Millar & Dillman 2011, Bandilla et al. 2012, Kaplowitz et al. 2012, Luiten & de Groot 2014, Ipsos MORI 2018, Schouten et al. 2022, etc.), and mixed-mode surveys (e.g. Rao et al. 2010, Millar & Dillman 2011, Dillman et al. 2014, Dillman 2017, Dillman et al. 2017, Luiten 2019, Schouten et al. 2022, Wilson & Dickinson 2022, etc.), regarding not only cross-sectional, but also longitudinal and panel surveys (e.g. Bosnjak et al. 2007, van den Brakel 2008, Rao et al. 2010, Calderwood 2013, Lynn 2016, etc.). Despite the large amount of knowledge thus accumulated, the field of advance letter design is still evolving, and dedicating a session to it with leading experts could not be more timely. The survey crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic hit NSOs and private organisations alike in an already decades-long decline of response propensity to surveys (Luiten et al. 2020). In these challenging times, conventional methods have to be revisited, as efficiency of past practices is decreasing (Dillman et al. 2014), which the pandemic proved, too. Furthermore, the post-pandemic survey landscape may well differ significantly from pre-COVID times (see e.g. Beck et al. 2022). Therefore, for resiliency in surveys, advance letters need also to be tailored to meet the new and old challenges better, which entails developing and testing new directions and novel practices. The session will give insight not only into the practical aspects of cutting-edge survey advance letter design and development, but also the underlying theoretical assumptions, the applied methods as well as future avenues for improvement. Regional differences will also be addressed by the diverse selection of presenting experts, for a good design factors in social–cultural characteristics of the target population as well. This enables prudently adapting instead of simply adopting practices developed for and tested on other populations. Beyond these, the session will provide: - in-depth understanding of different techniques: the official/mandatory approach (e.g. Dillman et al. 1996, Hagedorn et al. 2014, Barth et al. 2016, Oliver et al. 2016), the application of behavioural science techniques (e.g. Wilson & Dickinson 2022); - insights into short- and long-term effects of the various practices; - overview of the development process from planning phase through testing to the end-product; - recommendations for tailoring advance letters to challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic in a resilient and flexible advance communication framework; - and so forth.   References: Bandilla, W., Couper, M.

                 Prof. Arvind Rao ; PROF. DR. Elena Zarova ","The year 2022 marks the first year that artificial intelligence surpasses statistics as keywords on Google web search, compared to the 2000s when statistics had ten times more than artificial intelligence (https://trends.google.com). As part of artificial intelligence, machine learning has the same growing trend as artificial intelligence. However, their difference gets smaller and smaller. In the 2000s, artificial intelligence is 15 times as many as machine learning. The difference is reduced to four times. This summary is a typical example of descriptive statistics, which joins inferential statistics as the two major statistics divisions. As a branch of inferential statistics, statistical learning is the central hub that links to machine learning. The web search activity remains relatively constant for statistical learning. However, machine learning has gained 40-fold over statistics learning in the last five years compared to two-fold in the 2000s.
Their difference and similarity have been debated since the creation of these terms and will continue to emerge. Among the 212 Invited Paper Sessions (IPS) at the 63rd ISI WCS in 2021, there were three IPS on statistical learning: Advances in Statistical Learning Applications (IPS 40) Nonparametric Statistical Learning of Complex Data (IPS 80), and Statistical Learning Models in Practice (IPS 173). There were also three IPS on machine learning: Labeling Issues in Machine Learning Methodology (IPS 21), Stein’s method for Machine Learning (IPS 34), and Developing Machine Learning Methods in Experimental Official and Analytical Statistics (IPS 211). There was no session on both statistical learning and machine learning to address a critical question: how do we inspire each other to build better paths from data to conclusions? 
This invited paper session is organized to answer this question by Dr. Zhiwu Zhang, an Associate Professor at Washington State University. Dr. Zhang has developed multiple widely used statistical methods and computing tools for genome-wide association studies and genomic prediction (https://zzlab.net). Currently, Dr. Zhang is leading two USDA projects to apply artificial intelligence for improving wheat quality using hyperspectral images and plant breeding efficiency using both satellite and unmanned aerial vehicles. The IPS invited five diversified speakers, from theory to application, from medicine to economy, from statistical learning to machine learning and artificial intelligence. These speakers include Dr. Qiwei Li (The University of Texas at Dallas), Dr. Arvind Rao (University of Michigan), Dr. Honglang Wang (Purdue University), Dr. Shan Yu (University of Virginia), and Dr. Elena Zarova (Plekhanov Russian Academy of Economics). Their common interdisciplinary approach is to integrate human knowledge and computer capability to build explainable and predictable paths from data to conclusions.   Organiser:Prof. Zhiwu Zhang  Chair:Prof. Zhiwu Zhang  Speaker:Shan Yu  Speaker:Qiwei Li  Speaker:PROF.

Bayesian inference provides an efficient framework for quantifying uncertainty. However, quantification requires the computation of integrals with respect to the posterior distribution. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have been the gold standard for this purpose for the past thirty years. However, the classical methodologies are no longer suitable for modern high-dimensional and complicated dependent systems. The researchers in this session address this problem by proposing new efficient methodologies.  Prof. Jasra is well known in the field of sequential Monte Carlo methods and has recently developed a combination of filtering methods and multilevel computing. Dr. Kamatani is working on scalable Bayesian computational methods such as piecewise deterministic Markov processes. Dr. Duncan is a young talented researcher working on machine learning and scalable computation. Dr. Choi is also a young talented researcher actively working on non-reversible Markov chains and annealing methods for Bayesian analysis.  Two speakers are from East Asia (Singapore and Japan), one from the Middle East and one from Western Europe.

Experiences have shown that statistical computing aid teaching of statistics to statisticians and non-statisticians especially in developed countries while in African countries statistical computing for statistical capacity building is low among students and researchers in the field of statistics. 
Statistical computing techniques are critical in training and building the statistical capacity of students and researchers in statistical fields or other fields of human endevours. Through statistical computing techniques, the students acquire practical skills for handling data, managing data, analyzing data and learning other basic skills at the statistical capacity building events organized by International Association Statistical Computing (IASC)-African Members Group and Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Statistical Analysis (LISA) 2020 stat labs. While Researchers from other fields are provided with required statistical computing skills on study design, data collection, analysis and result interpretation. 
Important questions that comes to mind are: How are the statistical capacity building events and programme training students and researchers to become effective statistical data analyst? How are the capacity programme helping students to move between theory in the classroom and practice to solve real life problems? How are these statistical capacity building with statistical computing techniques serves the research needs in health, Agriculture, economics  and education etc? how are these statistical capacity building in helping to improve statistical skills and literacy in African countries? How are these statistical computing skills helping in preparing students to become entrepreneurs in statistics after schooling?

Modernization, standardization activities play a crucial role in streamlining business operations and therefore support national and international statistical organizations in strengthening their competitive advantage of producing high quality official statistics.    Defining organizational processes and describing elements of the architecture is the starting point of all improvement activities. Standards and models provide a basis for modernization and ensure the common language among statistical organizations that is needed for efficient international cooperation. Industry standards, especially ModernStats models of the UNECE Supporting Standards Group and the knowledge bases built around them by the international community are widely used by statistical organizations.    How do these organizations cope with the fast changes in the data ecosystem? What are the organizational solutions that enable flexibility and fast adaptation to the environment as well as the production of high quality statistics? What kind of support do statistical organizations need to enhance modernization? How can the international statistical community support modernization initiatives and facilitate sharing knowledge?    The session will provide:  –insight into the challenges statistical organizations face in the modernization of their production processes, their architecture: use cases (Canada, Hungary, IMF, Mexico); –standards, models, architecture frameworks statistical organizations use for modernization purposes, their needs and expectations; –possibilities and challenges of international cooperation: sharing good practices, promoting modernization and innovation among statistical organizations.

                 Dr Paolo Righi ","New data sources and data science tools are changing deeply the way in which statistical knowledge is being produced. This session aims at putting together examples of cutting edge theoretical and applied research in which the role of probability samples is highlighted as the cornerstone for successful statistical data analysis and/or integration. The session is structured in four talks and one discussant. In all talks, a (possibly small) probability sample is used to adjust the bias coming from self-selected samples or Big data sources and/or to effectively extract information from extremely Big and structured data. The talk by Maria del Mar Rueda (University of Granada, Spain) provides an up-to-date treatment of inference from non-probability samples also making use of machine learning methods and that by Paolo Righi (Italian National Statistical Office) provides an application of these methods that lead to the production of Experimental Official Statistics in Italy. The talk of Jae-Kwang Kim (Iowa State University, US) looks at data integration that can deal with a missing not at random situation using information from a small representative sample, while the contribution of Li Chun Zhang (Statistics Norway, University of Southampton) shows how sampling is necessary to obtain information on parameters defined on extremely large, complex and dynamic network structures. Andrea Diniz da Silva (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica) who has recently overviewed a consultation to National Statistical Offices in Latin America and the Caribbean on the use of Big Data will provide a discussion. Estimation in nonprobability samples with Propensity Score Adjustment and Kernel Weighting
Maria del Mar Rueda, University of Granada, Spain Nonprobability samples usually entail selection biases that may arise from substantial differences between the potentially covered population and the target population. In this work, we compare two design-based methods: Propensity Score Adjustment, which estimates the propensities using predictive models such as logistic regression or machine learning classifiers, and Kernel Weighting, which combines the estimation of propensities with sample matching. In addition, we also consider the use of weight smoothing to account for the estimation in multipurpose surveys, where the covariates used in the adjustments may be more suitable for some target variables than for others. New Data sources for improving Official Statistics
Paolo Righi, Istat The talk focuses on the Data Integration approach, which combines multiple sources (surveys with probabilistic samples, administrative data and Big Data) and considers two classes of estimators. The first class considers design-based estimators and uses Big Data as auxiliary information, the second class uses the probabilistic sample as a source auxiliary information and its estimators make model-based inference using Big Data. In the latter case, the probabilistic sample is useful for dealing with the selection bias of the non-probabilistic sample and for correcting the measurement error when the Big Data does not collect the target variable accurately. The two classes of estimators are applied on real survey and Big data.  Propensity score weighting for handling selection bias in voluntary samples
Jae Kwang Kim, Iowa State University Propensity score weighting is widely used to improve the representativeness and to correct the selection bias in the sample. In this talk, we consider an alternative approach of estimating the inverse of the propensity scores using the density ratio function. The smoothed density ratio function is obtained by the solution to the information projection onto the space satisfying the moment conditions on the balancing scores. The proposed approach is applicable to nonignorable selection model with some identifiability conditions.  Sampling for network function learning
Li-Chun Zhang To define what we call network functions, let us first envisage a valued graph, where the nodes represent the units and the edges the connections among them, and both the nodes and the edges may be associated with values in addition. Any network function for a given unit must then be defined in terms of both the corresponding node and the nodes connected to it, as well as the associated values. A basic difficulty for learning such network functions arises when the edges of the graph are unknown to start with, even when the entire set of nodes are known, such that the edges can only be partly observed by sampling from the collection of nodes and edges, i.e. the graph. In this talk, we consider the feasibility of graph sampling approach to network function learning, as well as the corresponding learning methods based on sample graphs.

                 Mr Veljko Uskokovic ","The session aims at gathering statisticians, data scientists and managers from the public, private and non-governmental sector whose specialization lies in both circular economy and composite indicator creation, evaluation and dissemination. The session strives to initiate discussion on an underrepresented direction of research – measuring circular economy activities using composite indicators. Namely, circular economy is a multidimensional phenomenon and therefore cannot be captured using solely individual indicators. The first paper has the goal to raise awareness on the issue of stability and robustness of composite indicators and inspects the Collaborative Economy Index on this matter. The following paper tackles the issue of grouping European Union countries based on their use of circular materials in the European Union. The specific case study presented in the following paper will observe a novel approach for creating composite indicators in the field of circular economy using ultrametric modelling. The final paper in the session will provide insights on the methodological aspect of the Circular Economy Index and the practical implications the chosen methodological steps have on the ranking of countries. The respective speakers, who are from both academia and NGO sector, who come from different countries and educational background, promise a presentation of scientific and statistical excellence with sense of practical implications, recommendations and suggestions for further research on the topic of understanding and measuring circular economy. Justification: The motivation for this session is to provide insights into the novel state-of-art statistical approaches used to create and evaluate composite indicators in the field of circular economy and to raise awareness on the role statistics play in the process. It is believed that the session is to act as an impetus for further development of methodologies used and for debate on the policy implications of multidimensional metrics related to circular economy.  Intended Audience: It is hoped that the IPS will attract a wide audience. On the previous 63rd World Statistics Congress, the session chair organized an IPS on the topic of composite indicator creation and evaluation which was attended and attracted audience. Therefore, the proposed session will be a continuation of good practice from the previous congress which will add to the growing amount of knowledge on the topic.

                 Prof. Atinuke Olusola Adebanji ","The LISA 2020 Program was started with the vision to promote statistical and data science capacity building in developing countries by creating a strong network of statistics and data science collaboration laboratories (“stat labs”). These stat labs worked with the objectives of becoming Engines for Development by training the next generation of collaborative statisticians and data scientists. Collaboration within the network was aimed at the coming together of researchers, data producers, and decision-makers to make a positive impact on society. Another goal of the network was to teach short courses and workshops to improve statistical skills and data literacy as widely as possible. The culmination of all the hard work and dedication of the LISA team is seem in the massive growth in the number of LISA Stat labs across many nations in Africa, India, and Pakistan. In the present day, the network has grown to 35 full member stat labs, 6 transitional labs approaching full membership, and 7 proposed stat labs that are in the early application stages with many more interested and learning more about the network. With such a robust network, the LISA 2020 Program encouraged the existing stat labs to improve their operations by adapting best practices learned from one another. The initiatives also seek to ensure the sustainability of the network itself and the various individual member stat labs. In this IPS, we wish to present some of these sustainability experiments and highlight the insights obtained from carrying them out. The Stat labs had all taken quite an innovative approaches in designing and conducting these experiment and it is our intention to showcase them to the entire network on the august platform of World Statistics Congress. Some of the labs have dedicated their time to setting up one on one sessions with a statisticians, like ""An hour with a Statistician"". Whereas in another, there is a long term project dedicated to educating and training women to participate in the Statistician cohort. Yet another interesting project undertaken is to create policy recommendations for increasing election participation. In this session, participants from different geographical locations, but all part of the big LISA family will talk about what they have done so far and how they intend to encourage Statistics education and to support the practice  of transforming data to insights.

A clear communication strategy to present the often complex and diverse results of any monitoring involving large indicator sets is therefore essential. While for evidence based policymaking, a comprehensive analysis of a topic including all indicators is mandatory, other types of uses and users may require aggregated and sharpened messages. Dashboards grouping a sub-set of indicators on a specific topic represent another, increasingly popular method to guide the users’ attention and present a clearer picture. However, the choice of indicators and their assessment methodology may strongly influence the results of such alternative approaches. To ensure coherent messages, good coordination with parallel monitoring exercises drawing on the same or similar indicators is therefore vital. The session will present good practices on how to interact with a broad range of users, such as policy makers, researchers, educators and entrepreneurs depending on the context and use case.  Moreover, it will highlight the communication challenges in case of dashboards covering closely linked topics (e.g. SDGs and wellbeing).

Based on the analyses and recommendations made in the presentations, the session will culminate with the demonstration of a toolkit (published in the Valuing of Official Statistics Report, endorsed at the CES in June, 2022) designed to facilitate the transition from largely production-based approaches, such as NSI metrics around quality, towards customer-centred measures of the value of official statistics.   The world is awash with data and NSIs are under increasing pressure to produce evidence of the impact of official statistics while the market for data and statistics widens, and the gap in the quality of statistics narrows. In their efforts to demonstrate the value of official statistics, the question that NSIs may benefit from asking is whose perception of value is important here and what exactly is being measured?   The participants propose a shift in the direction of how NSIs understand and measure their success. Instead of gathering individual metrics that strive to quantify how NSI outputs are distinctive and important, NSIs should focus on how they understand what users value, and how they are consistently delivering that value. NSIs are encouraged not to lose sight of their users and nonusers in their position as customers in the larger market of data and statistics.   To consistently win their preference, this session brings a suggestion to NSIs to reorient their focus from tracking production performance, to fine-tuning their understanding of what customers need. Some NSIs may have relied on user-satisfaction surveys for this purpose; however, these do not provide an all-encompassing customer perception of value: they are limited to reflections of experiences after engaging with a product (Sweeney and Soutar, 2001).  Our proposal consists of a collaborative session between:   - The Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR), from the United Kingdom, who will discuss their vision for statistics serving the public good, and   - Members of the Conference of European Statisticians Task Force to Test and Develop the Framework for Measuring the Value of Official Statistics (whose work was endorsed by the CES in June 2022) from Hungary, New Zealand and the UK.    The session will provide, among others:   - Insight into what it means for statistics to serve the public good, based on research with members of the general public   - A conceptual analysis of value in relation to objective and subjective measures of the properties of official statistics.   - Recommendations for NSIs to reassess the value they provide customers through their products and services, and on a wider scale, the extent to which their strategies are NSI- or customer-based.  - A toolkit to facilitate NSIs transitioning from production- to customer-centric strategies.    Proposed participants of the session Chair:  Ed Humpherson, Director General for the United Kingdom’s Office for Statistics Regulation  List of presenters:  1.

At the same time, global food demand continues to grow and regional changes and growing inequalities. As a result of all this, a an increase in the poor population is expected and the emergence of aspects undernutrition and malnutrition among the population, especially among the vulnerable groups of the population (children, the elderly, pregnant women, etc.).
In this global turmoil, food security, which was easy in rich countries, is not more possible today. Indeed, the question of food security has become a problem both for the rich and for the poor. However, the food sovereignty of countries has come is making a strong comeback after being neglected for years, especially with the return of confrontation between the great powers and the emergence of the will to control the global balance. Deficit in the supply of basic foodstuffs in the world markets, which is a pressure factor. This session offers a study of statistical approaches to assess aspects of food sovereignty in a world at a time of crisis.
This is to analyze the main statistical indicators, the minimum indicator matrix, to describe the state of food in the world and focus on a few case.

The analysis and interpretation of these kinds of data include the adaptation of existing methods, and development of novel statistical methods for specific data science applications. The discussion on advantages, disadvantages, limitations and requirements of the use of alternative methodologies and data sources, in all areas of knowledge, is setting the stage for the debate in (inter)national communities of statisticians, computer scientists and other communities, all over the world. The ISI Special Interest Group on Data Science was approved by the ISI Executive Committee and ISI Council in 2021 to: (i) To strengthen the collaboration between statisticians, computer scientists, and other communities in the field of data science. (ii) To provide a ‘big tent’ to all ISI members, and other colleagues interested in data science and data analytics, to sit under. (iii) To emphasize the importance of data science in the activities promoted by the ISI and its associations. (iv) To foster capacity building on data science, including computational skills among statisticians, and statistical skills among computational scientists. (v) To coordinate and to promote, in collaboration with the ISI and its Associations, specific activities in the field of data science. In this panel discussion, we aim to discuss the challenges and opportunities for the ISI and for the statistical community in this Era of Big Data and Data Science. The five panelists will bring points of view from four continents, with male and female representation. This panel discussion will be of great interest to all ISI WSC 2023 participants and will raise awareness of the ISI members to the ISI SIG on Data Science.

In these studies, the progression of disease can be closely monitored for a period of time and outcomes can be predicted more effectively by assessing temporal changes in responses. The analysis of follow-up studies with time-to-event observations is called longitudinal and survival data. For longitudinal gene expression data, it is observed that the measurements are often dependent on previous values, that is, they are auto‐correlated. The baseline expression value portrays a significant role and often the recent expression value is compared to the baseline value to draw the necessary inference. 
Time-varying biomarkers have become an effective indicator for identifying the disease progression in Oncology. This tool has been proven advantageous to detect tumor development at early stages and also benefits in treatment decision making. In practice, the information of expression values is collected for a large number of biomarkers, producing a high-dimensional structure of the dataset. However, these datasets often contain missing observations due to patient drop-outs which undermines the validity of the research results. Our research aims towards several challenges that appeared in the biomarker studies and develops an effective statistical procedure for classification and modeling of gene expression data.

Analytic inferences can provide insight into the relationships between a response and a covariate. Small area estimates offer a granular understanding of a quantity of interest. Complex survey designs are often informative, meaning the variable of interest is correlated with the inclusion probability, after conditioning on the model covariates. Informative sample designs generate numerous challenges for the analysis. Unique approaches to inference under informative sampling are proposed in this session. 
Model-based analyses of survey data are crucial for analytic inference and small area estimation. When the selection probability and the response variable are dependent, after conditioning on model covariates, the design is informative for the model. Ignoring an informative design can render invalid inferences. This session offers innovative methods for small area estimation and analytic inference in the presence of an informative design.

The call of the hour goes toward the (bio)statisticians/data-scientists to develop novel methods/computer algorithms to analyze and extract sensible meanings out of these high-/ultrahigh-dimensional data that pose challenges such as computational burden, statistical inaccuracy, and algorithmic instability. Specifically, a major daunting task is to discover authentic causal connections, if any, of these collected data to the outcome(s) of interest. Good news is that contemporary statistical/computational developments have started to successfully fathom answers to such challenges in data related to high-dimensional causal inference using tools such as machine learning and deep learning.

                 Francesca Grum ; Mr Adrian Franco Barrios ","Gender-based violence (GBV) is an important and persistent problem that affects our society. There is an urgent demand for measuring and monitoring the phenomenon from different perspectives to prevent, protect the victims and prosecute perpetrators of violence. Since GBV and Violence against women (VAW) are complex phenomena, it is preferable to address them using different sources and techniques. Some of them are more useful to estimate prevalence and incidence indicators, to give light to the hidden and unreported part of the phenomenon, to study the risks’ factors and causes and consequences of violence, like the survey on populations; while others sources as the census on shelters or the administrative data collections are more suitable to provide information on the protection and the response of the State. Recent works by Tur-Prats (2019), Gonzalez & Rodrıguez-Planas (2020) and Alesina et al. (2020), document the prominent role of cultural and social norms, which mainly refer to sexual stereotypes and the role of women in society. The strong lengths between gender stereotypes and the level of acceptance of GBV in Italy were also studied during the lockdown period. This study suggests that the media campaign's success (aimed at raising awareness to use the National Helpline against GBV and stalking) is, to some extent, responsive to women’s stereotypes rather than female economic status. So these studies raise questions on how to design appropriate interventions to encourage reporting of abuse and ultimately taper domestic violence. If only income matters, policymakers should invest in programs to reinforce women’s autonomy via improvements in labour market opportunities and the expansion of shelter availability. However, it is crucial to provide data related to the presence of Gender Stereotypes because they play a substantial role in combating the GBV. Neglecting the relevance of social norms might lead to an imperfect understanding of GBV and domestic violence and the mechanisms that incentivise reporting abuse and, in turn, loosely designed policies. This implies putting more effort into exploring the Gender Stereotype and the social image of violence, trying to connect periodically with new data sources. The new framework of big data can be considered a new frontier of statistical knowledge of social phenomena. Among the various available sources of Big Data, social media constitute a particularly useful resource of information for analysing the phenomenon of gender-based violence, cyber-violence and gender stereotypes. A challenging problem in this context is using this data to produce official statistics representative of the target population. No randomised sampling design facilitates the generalization of conclusions and results obtained with the available data to an intended larger target population. Hence, extracting statistically relevant information from these sources is challenging (Daas and Puts, 2014). It is important to underline that this paper is focused on describing the method adopted by enhancing the contents of the social media but doesn’t affect the crucial question related to the representative statistical sample of this content. It will be the second stage of this project. There is a growing concern about various issues associated with social media data. Boyd and Crawford (2012) ask whether such data may alter what “research” means and call for the need to question relevant assumptions and biases. Bright and al. (2014) argue that caution is needed when interpreting social media data, and major questions remain on how to employ such data properly. Hsieh and Murphy (2017) highlight what they call coverage error, query error and interpretation error in relation to Twitter data. Halford and al. (2017) underline the urgency to develop a better understanding of the construction and circulation of social media data, to evaluate their appropriate uses and the claims that might be made from them. There are also different methodological proposals to define a social media data quality framework to use as a sample. This session offers the opportunity to address the violence issue from different perspectives; with their contributions, the speakers will focus on the different aspects of the approaches and their strengths and weaknesses. This session's main aim is to discuss potential links between “official” and “trusted smart statistics” in finding new and more appropriate ways to study GBV.

Statistical inference of stochastic differential equations and stochastic partial differential equations plays an important role in the analysis of time-dependent phenomena. Diffusion processes, Lévy driven stochastic processes defined by stochastic differential equations, and the stochastic heat equation and the sea surface temperature model defined by the stochastic partial differential equation are important classes of continuous time stochastic processes. In this session, four speakers are invited to give a talk about statistical inference for continuous time stochastic processes based on discrete observations. They are Professors Michael Sorensen from University of Copenhagen, Nakahiro Yoshida from Kyushu University of Tokyo, Markus Bibinger from University of Würzburg and Masayuki Uchida from Osaka University. Professor Michael Sorensen is an expert in statistical inference for stochastic processes including continuous time stochastic processes such as models given by stochastic differential equations and jump processes. In particular, he is a pioneer in statistics based on martingale estimating functions for discretely observed stochastic differential equations. Professor Nakahiro Yoshida is an authority in the fields of quasi-likelihood analysis for stochastic processes including stochastic differential equations, and asymptotic expansion of statistics for stochastic differential equations in both ergodic and non-ergodic cases. Furthermore, he proved the mathematical validity of asymptotic expansion of Skorohod integrals converging to a mixed normal limit. Professor Markus Bibinger has made significant achievements in covariance estimation for stochastic differential equations based on noisy and nonsynchronous high‐frequency data. Recently he obtained minimum contrast estimators of stochastic partial differential equations in one space dimensions based on high-frequency spatio-temporal data. Professor Masayuki Uchida is a researcher of statistical inference of discretely observed stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations. Specifically, he has studied the problem of estimating unknown parameters for stochastic partial differential equations in two space dimensions from high-frequency spatio-temporal data. Professor Michael Sørensen will talk about simulating diffusion bridges using confluent diffusions. Simulation-based likelihood inference for discretely observed stochastic differential equation models requires simulation techniques for diffusions conditioned on hitting a given endpoint, so-called diffusion bridges. The talk presents a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that combines two previous methods to obtain an algorithm which 1) is exact in the sense that there is no discretization error, 2) has computational cost that is linear in the duration of the bridge, and 3) provides bounds on local maxima and minima of the simulated trajectory. The method is similar to that proposed by Bladt and Sørensen in 2014, but here the unconditional sample paths are simulated by a method without discretization error.
Professor Nakahiro Yoshida will present recent developments in statistics with the Malliavin calculus. Around 1990, the Malliavin calculus was first applied by the author to higher order inference for stochastic differential equations, and it induced various applications in statistics and finance. In 90’s, the higher order asymptotic distribution theory was extended by the martingale expansion and the expansion for continuous-time Markov processes, both based on the Malliavin calculus. The martingale expansion was extended around 2010 to non-ergodic statistics covering volatility estimation with high frequency data. Recently, essential generalizations of the theory have taken place toward general Wiener functionals, and Skorohod integrals in non-ergodic statistics. By these new engines, it has been possible to approach anticipative functionals, functionals of a fractional Brownian motion like fractional diffusions, and related statistical problems. In this talk, some of recent developments on the front of the theories and their applications in statistics are introduced.
Professor Markus Bibinger will talk about efficient parameter estimation for parabolic SPDEs based on a log-linear model. We present statistical methods to calibrate dynamic models based on stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). We construct estimators for the parameters of parabolic SPDEs based on discrete observations in time and space of a solution on a bounded domain. We point out the relation of power variation statistics to the response variable of a log-linear model. This allows to conclude about efficiency and minimal variances. We establish central limit theorems under high-frequency asymptotics. The asymptotic variances are smaller compared to existing estimation methods and asymptotic confidence intervals are directly feasible. We demonstrate the efficiency gains numerically and in Monte Carlo simulations.
Professor Masayuki Uchida will present parametric estimation of a parabolic linear second order stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) with two-dimensional space based on high-frequency spatio-temporal data. The minimum contrast estimator (MCE) of the diffusivity parameter and the curvature parameter in the SPDE are obtained by using the thinned data in space. The approximate coordinate process is derived from the MCE and the discrete observations. The adaptive estimator of the rest of coefficient parameters in the SPDE is constructed by using the thinned data in time obtained from the approximate coordinate process. It is shown that the adaptive estimator has consistency and asymptotic normality.

And for democracy index by the Economist Intelligence Unit and for the press freedom index published by Reporters Without Borders.   THE ROLE OF OFFICIAL STATISTICS IN A DEMOCRACY After the presentations of the data, it will start the discussion.   Every day, in the news, we listen to the employment rate, the GDP, mortality rate, car accidents and etc. All these statistics are collected, produced and then disseminate by the NSOs around the world. Also, COVID data should be produced by NSO (See Georgiou (2020) or Di Gennaro (2020)) What is the NSO? Why does the NSO exist? What is its role? The NSOs should be an independent body from the State. The NSOs are an established entity and independent of the government all over the world. The methodology used by NSOs is mostly established and coordinated by the United Nations. The statistics of the NSOs help the population to better understand and to assess how the government is managing the economy and society.    DATA FOR BETTER POLICY From the economic statistics point of view, only after the Second World War, thanks to Stone and Keynes among others, Tily (2009), the United Nations Statistical Commission highlighted the need for international statistical standards for the compilation and updating of comparable statistics in support of a large array of policy needs.  The census is the pinnacle of social statistics. The word ‘Census’ has a long history all over the world. For instance, in China and other countries, they started a systematic count of the population from 1600 -1700 B.C. according to Zhu (1987). Every country has one NSO in charge of the decennial census, that is, the social statistics and the main economic statistics. Every 10 years, all over the world, the census is implemented.    THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NATIONAL STATISTICS OFFICES IN DEMOCRACY Nations Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, in which it was stated that: ‘Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society, serving the government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation’, United Nations, 1994. The first principle of European statistics (Eurostat) code of practice is on Professional Independence: ‘Professional independence of statistical authorities from other policy, regulatory or administrative departments and bodies, as well as from private sector operators, ensures the credibility of European Statistics’. One of the 35 chapters to enter in the European Union (1985) is fully dedicated to ‘official statistics’.   REFERENCE Di Gennaro Splendore, Luca (2020), 'COVID-19: Unprecedented Situation, Unprecedented Ofﬁcial Statistics', Journal of Ofﬁcial Statistics (JOS) Georgiou, Andreas, (2020) ‘Defeating the Pandemic Requires High Quality and Ethical Official Statistics’, JOS Tily, Geoff (2009).

                 Dr Georges-Simon Ulrich ","In the first part of the session, the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO) will provide a short overview of the topic of Data Stewardship in the context of administrative and statistical data and will present its specific data stewardship model, which is going to be implemented in the Swiss administration. The keynote speech will be followed by three expert talks. The session ends in a panel discus. This session is part of the “Unlocking the Power of Data Initiative"", launched by the Swiss Confederation. It belongs to the workstream ""Data Management"", and is an integral part of the efforts to bridge the gap between the data and statistical community. The history of the FSO goes back to the year 1850 when Stefano Franscini planned and conducted the first federal census. Since then, the FSO has been responsible for the census and over time became the national competence centre for official statistics. However, there was a subtle but clear trend in recent years: Many national statistical offices (NSOs) observe that they are increasingly responsible for an ever-broadening set of data management tasks within their respective public administrations. This almost immediately leads to the topic of data quality. The concept of Data Stewardship is quite common within large corporations to ensure a high degree of data quality. In short, a data steward is a person (or group of people) who is responsible for the quality of a defined part of the organisation’s data space. Nowadays, the public administrations of many countries are striving to embrace this concept too. Since NSOs typically have a deep understanding of their country’s data landscape, they are usually best suited for the role of a National Data Steward. The FSO is probably not the only NSO to promote Data Stewardship – but is certainly among those with the broadest and most consequent approach, and it has a very strong institutional backing: At its meeting of 27 September 2019, the Swiss Federal Council launched a programme called “National Data Management (NaDB)”. Besides serving as the basis for the implementation of the “Once-Only-Principle” in Switzerland, NaDB also anchors the concept of Data Stewardship throughout the entire public administration! 
The FSO’s Data Steward model covers the statistical and the administrative sphere of the Swiss data landscape. Because of the administration’s structure – which is distributed over three governmental levels - it was necessary to develop a process for an efficient collaboration between all parties involved. Therefore, Data Stewards reside not only on all institutional levels and within different topics (e.g., geography), they are also coordinated and directed by a federal entity: the Swiss Data Steward, represented by the head of FSO.
Although there is still some work ahead, the participants can learn from FSO’s experiences and therefore prepare for the challenges they might face when implementing an ambitious Data Steward approach in their countries. 
This session is organized within the framework of the “Unlocking the Power of Data Initiative”, a project launched by the Swiss Confederation to expand the dialogue on data and statistics beyond the data and statistics communities and deepen knowledge. This session will be the fourth event of the Data Management workstream, following its launch at a side event of the UN Statistical Commission, a conference in Geneva and an event in Basel, Switzerland.

Bravo de Guenni ","Over the 2021-2022 academic year, the International Environmetrics Society created three virtual working groups to further advancements in environmental statistics, with the overall aim of improving networking and creative collaboration across its members. The focus of these working groups was in the areas of (i) Bayesian methods for complex environmental systems, (ii) Bayesian modeling to apportion ultra-fine particles into their sources, and (iii) AI in environmental statistics. These working groups have made not only significant contributions, which are highlighted in this session, but also represent a successful example of virtual collaboration for making science.   Title: Mixed Bayesian compressed regression for multivariate models for large correlated geospatial data-sets 
Abstract: Modeling complex high-dimensional geostatistical data presents many computational challenges, which has led to substantive algorithmic developments, beyond the possible need for high-performance computing. Even with these developments, the challenges for model fitting and inference handling multivariate inference, especially within a Bayesian statistical framework, are still substantial. Here, we offer an extension of the efficient new sampling algorithm developed by Moran and Weller (2022), named as Fast Increased Fidelity Approximate Gaussian Process (FIFA-GP), to multivariate spatial data observed at fixed locations of a region. This algorithm takes advantage of $\mathcal{H}$-matrices approximation of the matrices comprising the GP posterior covariance, and allows to move from a cubic complexity to a near linear complexity. We demonstrate the scalability of the proposed approach using synthetic data as well as existing geospatial ecological data. Title: A novel Bayesian framework for source apportionment of particle number size distribution 
Abstract: The increase in health risk due to particle pollution exposure is a constant concern for society. Particulate Matter (PM) is a combination of different components from multiple sources. The identification of those sources is of vital importance to generate effective air pollution-health policies and regulations. In this work, we present a flexible statistical approach to apportion air pollution particles into their sources. While factor analysis, and particularly Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), might be the usual approach to this problem, we propose a novel Bayesian modelling framework to overcome the limitations that these traditional models have. Indeed, we modelled source contribution with a Dirichlet process, which allowed us to estimate the number of components that contribute to the particle concentration rather than fixing it. This allowed us to identify latent sources without needing to specify their number a priori. Furthermore, we extended the DP framework by allowing dependence from meteorological variables like wind speed and wind direction, while also smoothing the process using a flexible Gaussian kernel. We applied our method for Particle Number Size Distribution (PNSD) data time series gathered near London Gatwick Airport (UK) in 2019. The results exhibited the effectiveness of our proposed approach to identify the expected sources as well as new ones not previously identified by other methodologies.  Title: Explainable AI, Uncertainty, and Environmental Modeling 
Abstract: Statisticians, grounded as they are in the core problems of uncertainty quantification and inference, have had historic issues with machine learning and deep neural network models due to their limited access to the same. In this talk, we will review the key findings of these explorations, including both results for explainability of model-input importance, and coverage and performance of uncertainty quantified model outputs, both in the context of environmental modeling problems.

(ii) Does a quantity of interest take a particular value (hypothesis assessment)? 
(iii) Furthermore, any such theory should also say something about how strong the evidence is. Just as an estimate 
      without an assessment of its accuracy is useless, hypothesis assessment calls for the quantification of evidential strength.  Given the centrality of the evidence it seems natural that a characterization of how statistical evidence is to be measured 
should play a primary role in determining the theory of inference. The purpose of this session is to consider recently developed 
approaches to the development of a theory of statistical inference that include an explicit characterization of how statistical 
evidence is to be measured. Such a theory has the potential to remove many of the ambiguities/paradoxes that currently cause

We present two innovative data literacy initiatives in the UK and introduce a project that is working across Latin America to extend the reach of the ‘lessons learned’ on developing data literacy through these two activities. We focus on building bridges between disciplines, STEM and Social Sciences, to develop data literacy skills training, and experiential learning, that can lead to careers in data professions. Whilst the focus of the paper is on education and training, the context of the findings is grounded in data careers and describes how universities can and are developing courses and skills, in different subject areas, to develop a talent pipeline for these careers.  In UK higher education an ambitious £19.5m initiative – called Q-Step – designed to create a step-change in developing quantitative research skills in the social sciences ran from 2013-2021. The Data Fellows programme developed by one UK university (University of Manchester) that participated in the Q-Step programme has enabled 330 social science undergraduates – Data Fellows – to complete paid work placements, undertaking data-driven research projects in industry. We describe the model and the analytical, research and professional skills frameworks developed to evaluate the outcomes (Carter, 2021). The Data Fellows programme was designed to be inclusive; 70% have been female, and 25% from historically under-represented groups. All Data Fellows have studied pre-requisite data analysis courses. The fellowships enable them to put their classroom learning into practice in the workplace.  Drawing on Data Fellows' own reflections, we present case studies about how the fellowship assisted them to find employment in data careers. We evidence how experiential learning through Data Fellowships can provide a catalyst to enter and flourish in data careers. Moreover, we show how by addressing inclusivity through the programme design we can create a more diverse talent pipeline. Attention will be given to the skills taught at university as well as the skills requested by data careers professionals to attract data literate graduates into their organisations, across multiple sectors and job roles.   The UKDS (UK Data Service) provides a suite of online Data Skills training which is open to all and free to access. We further present emerging findings from a qualitative research project that explores how students are participating in these online data skills training to enhance their data literacy, and exploring the impact that these resources have on their learning.   This session will critically discuss the outcomes of the Data Fellows and Data Skills programmes and show how, through the EmpoderaData project, the authors are bringing the findings to an international audience. Through working collaboratively with colleagues in Latin America we are building bridges between Social Science training for data literacy, online training for Data Skills and engaging STEM undergraduates to develop their data literacy in applied social contexts.

                 Dr Dorcas Modupe Okewole ; Mr Peter Ohue; Ayobami Fadilat Gboyega","Description There has been a paradigm shift in the use and evaluation of pedagogical skills of learners and teachers with reference to the recent pandemic. Learning has gone beyond mere memorization of facts to practical application, including but not limited to effective communication, problem solving, creative thinking and building team work. The idea is that, there is a blend of face-to-face learning and on-line learning which is driven by technology and its tools. Hybrid learning (a fancy name for blended learning) creates a platform for learners to utilize digital tools with a lot of malleability. This learning concept is currently changing its meaning with external environment and time; with major concepts; such as combination of diverse teaching methods to produce optimal learning outcomes through various teaching techniques; integrating multiple networked technologies (such as classrooms, collaborative learning, real-time virtual self-paced learning, streaming video, audio, and text) to achieve educational goals. This also includes mixing instructional technologies with real work tasks to ensure consistency between learning and work; and synergistically combining various instructional technologies (e.g., video and movies) with face-to-face teacher-led education (Qianqian Xie et al., 2021). Blended learning has the capacity to boost the experience of learners by promoting both virtual and physical learning domains. With regards to statistical literacy, what exactly is blended learner? What are the digital tools for delivering online learning? How far have schools in Africa incorporated blended learning into their syllabuses? What is the cost benefit compared to the classical methods of learning? What are the main challenges and the opportunities that this provides? In the light of the pandemic, how should government and educational administrators revise their curriculum in order to maximize the gains from the use of technological tools? This is a major factor that contributes to economic growth and development and should be of interest to institutions, international organizations, and members of the academia, sponsors and professional bodies. This IPS session is intended to dwell on the different ways of achieving blended learning as a means of improving statistical literacy in Africa. Four speakers from different universities in Africa will speak on how blended learning has been implemented and how much impact it has had on academic performance with a focus on statistics programmes in their respective institutions.   Justification Covid-19 pandemic and the aftermath have reinforced the need to further incorporate the efficient utilization of digital tools. There are threats to incorporating blended learning as a result of the negative disposition of a few critical stakeholders. If this trend is not addressed, the gains from adopting blended learning may not be actualized. A combination of virtual and in-person learning complement each other and it is expected that significant value should be added to learners’ experience; because hybrid learning makes it possible for students to determine the pace of learning. Literature shows that the rate of failure has significantly reduced and learning has been reportedly become more interactive and enjoyable. In terms of model, there are four models of blended learning (see https://www.panopto.com/blog/4-models-of-blended-learning/). With the hype about big data analytics and the opportunities provided by social media platforms, it is important to seek for ways to improve analytical and programming skills of graduating statistics students. In addition, Learning Management Systems (LMS) and Massive Open and Online Courses (MOOC) are huge resources and platforms for statistical learning. The cost benefit of engaging in a hybrid format of learning is another motivation for this proposal. The robustness of this approach will be tested in comparison to other alternative approaches.

In this session, a good mixture of practical and theoretical talks showcases novel findings and cutting-edge achievements in functional and high-dimensional data analysis. In view of the variety of topics covered by the talks with emphasis on applications to fields including neuroscience, public health and pharmaceutical statistics, the session will attract a wide audience consisting of mathematical statisticians, epidemiologists, data scientists and other applied researchers from industry and government.  In this session, we gather four promising statisticians from various research areas and three different countries (Israel, Canada, U.S.A.) to discuss newly merged functional and high-dimensional data. Specifically, the four speakers will present functional data classification based on the deep learning method and reproducing kernel Hilbert space framework. They will show that the proposed classifiers can achieve upper bound of the minimax optimality under mild assumptions.

Often, migrant workers are also part of what is known as “elusive populations”, making it not only difficult to define statistically but also to capture in data collections not specifically designed for this purpose.  Regular data sources including population censuses, household surveys and administrative records usually provide only a partial picture of international labour migration in a given country.  As international migration becomes more integrated as a catalyst for development in global accords including the UN Global Compact on Migration, the SDG 2030 agenda, and the ILO Fair Migration Agenda, the need for comprehensive, reliable and regular statistics on the different groups of migrant workers has become more pressing to ensure the development benefits of international labour migration are shared by all -workers, employers and governments in countries of origin and destination.   Following the adoption in 2018 of new Guidelines on statistics of international labour migration by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians, the ILO in collaboration with partner countries and agencies, has launched a number of initiatives at global, regional and country level to improve the availability of statistics on international migrant workers. This session aims at showcasing some of the good practices and progress achieved to date, from enhancing global guidance and data availability, to assessing the quality of the existing sources, exploring adjustments to improve them, harnessing available data, and integrating the SDG commitments on fair migration in official statistics.   The session is also meant to provide cases and approaches of successful measurement of international labour migration, so that more National Statistical Offices can use those examples to shed light on the relevance, situation and contributions of international migrant workers, worldwide.

Complex systems can be modeled and analyzed using network analysis where components of the system are treated as nodes. In these networks, the nodes interact over time creating edges. The edges are random variables creating dynamic networks that change over time. Examples of dynamic networks include social networks, biological networks, financial networks, and computer networks. Typically, these networks are large and sparse: the number of nodes is large and the number of edges is small comparatively. In this session, the talks will discuss methodological advances for modeling, monitoring, analyzing, and conducting inference within, large dynamic networks.

                 PROF. DR. Ralf Münnich ","In recent decades, an ever-expanding policy-oriented empirical research has emerged due to the increasing computational power and availability of microdata. Empirically guided policy needs ex-ante analyses to evaluate potential policy measures. Micro-based ex-ante simulation analysis is nowadays used extensively around the world for policy analysis and design in different fields. Microsimulation and its ability to simulate counterfactual ""what-if"" scenarios is a particularly suitable technique for maximizing the use and value of data for better decision making. The focus of the session will be on methods and tools as well as simulation infrastructures for the scientific community that foster policy-oriented research based on microdata data and statistics. Central aspects are the supply of underlying data while ensuring confidentiality, accessibility of programs and functions with the possibility of own adaptations and the provision of computing capacities for the execution of complex simulation runs. The session provides an overview of relevant tools, modern techniques, as well as geo-spatial modelling towards small scales or geo-locations. Special emphasis will be laid on using official or new digital data and the use of microsimulation to support official statistics. Finally, open data and research will be discussed. Statistics Canada is a world leading National Statistical Institute with long experience in microsimulation modelling with policy applications. The JRC in Seville is responsible for advancing microsimulation modelling for policy support in the European Commission, now enhancing the well-known Euromod microsimulation tool with European Statistical Office Eurostat.

                 Prof. George C. Tseng ","With the advances of technology and increases in computational speed, the need to analyze large-scale data has emerged. Multi-cohort, multi-source and multi-modal datasets often need to be combined for integrated clustering, increased statistical power, reduced biases of estimation of treatment or causal effects, among many other analytical purposes. Therefore, we propose to organize an invited session to bring leading researchers together to share their recent research advances and discuss ideas and important issues in the fields. In this session, speakers will be invited to present their latest work in data integrative analysis and meta-analysis, providing an interaction and brainstorming opportunity for researchers in these two fast evolving and growing fields.  Presenters are from United States, Hong Kong and Taiwan.   1. Presenter: Dr. Fangda Song   Title: Integrating multiple single-cell RNA-seq datasets for differential inference   When performing joint cell type clustering by integrating multiple Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets, people always ignore the treatment or biological conditions of the cells. Here, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to rigorously quantify the treatment effects on both cellular compositions and cell-type-specific gene expression levels for scRNA-seq data and an algorithm to handle the large number of cells. Application of our proposed method to pancreatic scRNA-seq datasets demonstrates that considering the biological conditions further boosts the clustering accuracy and identifies cell-type-specific and condition-specific differentially expressed genes.   2.Presenter: George Tseng (Prof., University of Pittsburgh) Title:  On p-value combination of independent and frequent signals: asymptotic efficiency and Fisher ensemble   Here we focus on revisiting a classical scenario of p-value combination, combining a small number of p-values while the sample size generating each p-value goes to infinity. We evaluate many traditional and recently developed modified Fisher's methods to investigate their asymptotic efficiencies and finite-sample performance and concludes that Fisher and adaptively weighted Fisher method have top performance and complementary advantages across different proportions of signals. Then we propose a so-called Fisher ensemble method that combines these two Fisher-related methods using the harmonic mean ensemble approach and show that it achieves asymptotic Bahadur optimality and integrates the strengths of both methods in simulations. We subsequently extend Fisher ensemble for concordant effect size directions. A transcriptomics meta-analysis application confirms the theoretical and simulation conclusions.     3.Presenter: Ming-Chieh Shih (Prof., National Dong-Hua University) Title: Validation of observational data evidence for treatment effects with randomized clinical trials.   Randomized clinical trials provide unbiased treatment effect estimates by design; however, the inclusion criteria of randomized clinical trials are often limited. Therefore, for certain target population, one must turn to observational studies to infer treatment effects, at the risk of bias within these observations. Here we propose a test that validates the conditional average treatment effect estimates from observational studies using randomized clinical trial data based on a maximum moment restrictions approach. We show that this test has asymptotic power of one and demonstrate its properties using real-world data from Women's Health Initiative.   4. Presenter: Dr. Chung Chang Title: Heavy-tailed distribution for combining dependent p-values with asymptotic robustness
The issue of combining individual p-values to aggregate multiple small effects is a longstanding statistical topic. Many classical methods are designed for combining independent and frequent signals using the sum of transformed p-values with the transformation of light-tailed distributions, in which Fisher’s method and Stouffer’s method are the most well-known. In recent years, advances in big data promoted methods to aggregate correlated, sparse and weak signals; among them, Cauchy and harmonic mean combination tests were proposed to robustly combine p-values under unspecified dependency structure. Both of the proposed tests are the transformation of heavy-tailed distributions for improved power with the sparse signal. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the transformation of regularly varying distributions, which is a rich family of heavy-tailed distribution, to explore the conditions for a method to possess robustness to dependency and optimality of power for sparse signals. We show that only an equivalent class of Cauchy and harmonic mean tests has sufficient robustness to dependency in a practical sense. Moreover, a practical guideline to adjust significance level under dependency is provided based on our theorem and simulation. We also show an issue caused by large negative penalty in the Cauchy method and propose a simple, yet practical modification with fast computation. Finally, we present simulations and apply to a neuroticism GWAS application to verify the discovered theoretical insights.   Organiser: Dr Chung Chang  Chair: Dr Chung Chang  Speaker:Dr. Fangda Song   Speaker: Prof. George C.

                 Mr Jorrit Zwijnenburg ","(session organized by the International Association for Research in Income and Wealth) Inequality is rising around the world and National Statistical Offices are measuring the changes in inequality using three dimensions of economic well-being - Income, Consumption and Wealth. International associations like OECD and EUROSTAT have coordinated efforts across countries to develop best practices and comparable estimates in order to evaluate differences across countries. This session is sponsored by the International Association for Research in Income and Wealth, and includes experts in measuring disparities in income, consumption and wealth in and across countries. These experts will provide national and international estimates that demonstrate the changes in inequality across all three dimensions. Panel includes four papers
Paper 1: Statistics Canada’s Sub-annual Distributions of Household Economic Accounts 
After the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic Statistics Canada began developing sub-annual Distributions of Household Economic Accounts (DHEA). Leveraging the agency’s long standing Social Policy Simulation Database and Model (SPSD-M), as well as some new nowcasting efforts, survey and administrative data sources, the team was able to produce quarterly DHEAs which lagged the reference period by approximately 6 months. Statistics Canada is continually working to enhance its sub-annual DHEAs, including adding further granularity and improving differences between micro and macro data sources. This presentation will provide an overview of Statistics Canada’s sub-annual  Paper 2: International Efforts to Measure Disparities in Income, Consumption and Wealth
The OECD and Eurostat have developed methodology and engaged in several rounds of data collection to measure disparities in line with national accounts (DNA). These estimates complement existing indicators on economic inequality by providing more comprehensive measures of inequality, by extending the analysis from income to consumption and saving, and by providing results that are fully consistent with macroeconomic aggregates. This paper presents the latest developments of the DNA work. The results show that Mexico and the United States record the highest income disparities, with Ireland, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Slovenia on the other end of the spectrum. The paper also examines differences across socio-demographic characteristics of individuals and households in various quintiles. Paper 3: What Money Can Buy: A Joint Distribution of Personal Income and Personal Consumption Expenditures
The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have recently constructed a new joint distribution of personal income and personal consumption expenditures. As a prototype exercise for 2019, this is the first such joint distribution for the U.S., consistent with national accounts. By developing a new methodology to link these distributions, BEA and BLS will allow users to analyze the distributions of income and consumption expenditures for the same quantiles. Though such linkages are challenging and have limitations, this exercise presents an important step in bridging that gap for national accounts. Paper 4: Intergenerational Mobility using Income, Consumption, and Wealth
We use fifty years of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to study the intergenerational correlation in income, consumption, and wealth for the same individuals and find that income exhibits the highest intergenerational correlation, or lowest mobility, followed closely by consumption and a larger difference for wealth. Our findings highlight the importance of using the same sample to study the three measures, as our consumption rank-rank slope is higher than the income rank-rank slope found in the literature, but our consumption rank-rank slope is lower than our own income rank-rank slope. Relative mobility is lowest for income, followed by consumption and wealth. However, we find that high wealth in childhood supplements low income or low consumption in childhood, increasing upward mobility for those with low income or consumption in childhood.

Administrative data, such as census-based data on risk factors, tends to be poor. Survey data can be high quality but with sparse geographical coverage. Hierarchical models which pool information across different different datasets, with appropriate model assumptions, can be used to overcome such problems. Talks will describe novel methodology related to hierarchical models motivated by different applications in Global Health. Monica Alexander (University of Toronto) Estimating the timing of stillbirths in countries worldwide using a Bayesian penalized splines regression Reducing the global burden of stillbirths is an important part of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals agenda in improving child and maternal health. Of particular interest is understanding patterns in the timing of stillbirths — that is, whether they occur in the intra- or antepartum period — because stillbirths that occur after the onset of labor are largely preventable. However, data that exist on the timing of stillbirths is highly variable across the world, with low- and middle-income countries generally having very few observations available. In this paper we develop a Bayesian penalized splines regression framework to estimate the proportion of stillbirths that are intrapartum for all countries worldwide. The model accounts for known relationships with neonatal mortality, pools information across geographic regions, accounts for different errors based on data source type, and allows for data-driven trends. Results suggest that the intrapartum proportion is generally decreasing over time, but progress is slower in some regions, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa.  Emanuele Giorgi (Lancaster University) Combining geostatistical and mechanistic models for efficient post-elimination surveillance strategies for neglected tropical diseases Sujit Sahu (University of Southampton)  Spatio-temporal detection for dengue outbreaks in the Central Region of Malaysia using climatic drivers at mesoscale and synoptic scale Organiser: Dr Patrick Brown  Chair: Dr Patrick Brown  Speaker:Sayantee Jana  Speaker: Monica Alexander  Speaker: Lucinda Hadley",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/397/details/

                 Dr Ronald Jansen ","The term “Fourth Industrial Revolution” was coined by World Economic Forum (WEF) chairman Klaus Schwab in 2015. He describes it as an exponential growth of several key technological fields’ concepts, such as smart materials and blockchain technology. The effects of technologies have provided new avenues of data for official statistics, which can then be harnessed through the power of data science. At its core, data represents a post-industrial opportunity. Data is increasingly building upon who we are, who we know, where we are, have been, and where we plan to go. Mining and analyzing this data lets us understand and predict how people behave at the individual, group, and global levels. These swathes of new digital data are as valuable for official statistics. However, the volume and variety of data have far outstripped the capacity of manual analysis. As data continue to grow in size and complexity, new algorithms need to be developed so as to learn from diverse data sources. The limitation of conventional statistics in managing and analyzing big data has inspired data analysts to venture into data science. Data Science combines multiple disciplines that use statistics, data analysis, and machine learning to analyze data, and extract knowledge and insights from it. This invited paper session highlights: the new data ecosystem available for timely policy and decision-makers as the world moves into the fourth industrial revolution in which mobile communications, social media, and sensors are blurring the boundaries between people, the Internet, and the physical world; the role of statistics and Statisticians in data science, and various opportunities for official statistics.

                 Dr Andrea Del Monaco ","Data science tools and techniques in the central bank environment have mainly focused on policy-related applications. For example, machine learning techniques have been used to develop high-frequency indicators of inflation, and the measurement of people’s inflation perception using social media data sources, etc. In parallel, the exponential rise of available structured and unstructured data in the internet allows statistical organizations to build, enhance or collect data and indicators in new ways. In this new digital age, indicators stemming from large data sets of multinational firms can be constructed in a timelier manner, with the help of public-private partnership and other types of co-operation. A prerequisite for those indicators are sound methodologies and a standardized exchange of data in suitable data formats. This development is at the research frontier, and there are encouraging examples in Banking Supervision, Fintech Monitoring and information extraction for Sustainable Finance purposes. The approach promises real time information that comes without the contorted process of enacting mandatory reporting. The aim of this session is to focus specifically on how data science can contribute (and have contributed) to the statistics production process at central banks. Some topics include (but not limited to): (1) the automation and optimisation of statistics production processes (including dissemination and reporting), (2) the use of novel techniques in the areas of cluster analysis, outlier identification and treatment, as well as survey-level imputation, (3)  the development of open-source data management platforms and its integration with existing internal systems , (4) internally-developed business intelligence (front-end) solutions for internal and external stakeholders, and (5) the sourcing, processing and dissemination of statistics using non-traditional sources of data. Lastly, central bank representatives will showcase what has been done in their respective areas on the topic. There is in particular interest in the toolchains and workflows used by central bank data scientists to enhance the sourcing, compilation, and dissemination process. The interactions with the information technology department regarding architectural designs (tech stack), the introduction of new technology, and cybersecurity considerations (and the associated challenges/opportunities) would also be analysed.

                 Viveka Palm ; Ms Olga Swierkot-Struzewska ","Disinformation is one of the major challenges that societies worldwide face today. It affects everyone involved in the democratic process, from governmental offices, politicians, the media, to citizens. Its spread has disrupted democratic elections, diplomatic relations and, recently, has endangered public health. Official statistics producers are not immune to this epidemic. Many have been targeted by individuals and organisations questioning the credibility of official statistics or even that of official statistics producers themselves. Democratic societies cannot function properly without a solid basis of reliable and objective statistics. Disinformation continues to represent a serious risk to our societies and its instigators' tools and tactics are becoming increasingly sophisticated. It is therefore more important than ever for official statistics producers to maintain their reputation and to reassert their role as providers of trustworthy, independent and high quality statistics. This session will look at the issue of disinformation in the context of official statistics, present the main problems related to disinformation as experienced by national and international organisations, and give an overview of the most effective responses, including strategies and tools employed by statistical organisations, in the process of combatting the spread of ‘fake news’.

                 Stefano Falorsi","In an era characterized by the proliferation of new data sources and an unprecedented data revolution, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the overall goal of leaving no-one behind have generated a tremendous increase in the demand of disaggregated data and statistics. In this framework, traditional sample surveys can provide important information on the social, economic and environmental dimensions of target populations, representing the essential data source to produce the official estimates of about the 30% of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicators. However, these data sources alone are not enough to realize the ambitious goal of monitoring SDG Indicators by all relevant disaggregation dimensions and geographic locations. Indeed, most sample surveys are characterized by sample sizes that are either not large enough to guarantee reliable direct estimates for all sub-populations or that do not cover all possible disaggregation domains. Issues of this kind can be addressed at different stages of the statistical production process. They can be tackled at the design stage, by adopting sampling strategies guaranteeing an observed set of sampling units for every disaggregation domain. Although potentially optimal, this approach normally results in an exponential increase of the sampling size and survey costs and complexity. Alternatively, data disaggregation can be addressed at the data analysis stage, by adopting indirect estimation approaches borrowing strength from related disaggregation domains and/or time periods, thus resulting in an increase of the effective sample size.  Small Area Estimation (SAE) methods are among the possible indirect estimation approaches that can be adopted to deal with data disaggregation at the analysis stage. SAE techniques allow combining survey data with auxiliary information coming from additional data sources that are not affected by sampling error. Traditionally, SAE have relied on the integration of survey data with information from population and agricultural censuses through explicit models linking the variable of interest to a set of auxiliary variables. However, with more and more data made available to the statistical community from multiple innovative data sources, relying exclusively on auxiliary variables from official statistical sources does not sound as an optimal solution. In this respect, the 2030 Agenda explicitly stresses the need for new and enhanced data integration strategies, including the exploitation of the potential contribution to be made by administrative registers, geospatial information systems and other big data sources. Within this framework, the present Invited Paper Session (IPS) will discuss the various potentialities offered by SAE and other indirect estimation techniques to produce granular disaggregated estimates of SDG and other national priority indicators, by integrating survey data with auxiliary information retrieved from traditional and/or innovative data sources. The speakers will present different examples of how SAE is used by international organizations and other national statistical offices to monitor the SDGs and other priority development objectives.

                 Mr Naman Keita","The weakness of statistical systems and scarcity of relevant data for compiling indicators is a major challenge for monitoring of SDGs. Global capacity building and assistance programmes and projects are providing the opportunity to upgrade national statistical systems in many developing countries. Given the potential long lasting impact of these activities at country level, this session will be of high interest to these countries in discussing what improvement can be done in the quality of data based on findings from recent country experiences. Following the adoption of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) agreed on a list of 232 global indicators to track the progress of the 169 targets and 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This includes a large number of multidimensional agricultural-related targets and global indicators to be monitored on a regular basis. The SDG agenda is ambitious since it foresees not only reducing, but eliminating hunger (indicators for values close to 0) which requires highly disaggregated data.   As a first step, concepts, definitions and adequate methodologies have to be developed and agreed at international level. For that purpose, an Inter-Agency and Expert Group (IAEG) for SDGs was put in place by the UNSC, working with specialized UN Agencies to formalize the definitions and methodologies for compiling various indicators.   On the data side, in many developing countries, the main data sources relevant to the indicators are censuses and surveys and to some extent administrative data systems. However, for indicators related to the food and agriculture sector, censuses and surveys are not always regularly conducted and administrative data is often reduced to reporting systems from decentralized branches in the field at local and regional levels. Therefore, monitoring SDG indicators in this situation of data scarcity is a major challenge in many developing countries.   To address these challenges, the international community has developed capacity building and technical assistance programmes and projects to upgrade data systems in many countries to fill data gaps for compiling the SDG indicators.   This Session will discuss some of the most important lessons learned from recent programmes to assist countries in monitoring selected SDG indicators. Three papers will be presented during this Session: •First paper: by Seid Yakob Mudesir, Adechian Djabar Dine, Audrier Sanou, and Naman Keita will discuss the methodological and data challenges for computing SDG indicators 2.3.1 and 2.3.2: Lessons learned from selected country experiences. •The second paper by Aida Clara Khalil will discuss the methodologies and data requirements for disaggregation of SDG indicators. •The third paper by Mariana Toteva and Eric Kabore will present the methodology for farm typology and its implementation in specific country context as well as some lessons learned.

 17 July 2023,Monday,16:00,17:25,IPS 484 - Subgroup Analysis in Drug Development,IPS Room 213,Category: IPS,,,"In a randomized clinical trial, the treatment population is generally heterogeneous having a differential response to the received investigational treatment. There may be several genomic and baseline characterestics for such response. One of the key roles for statisticians is to determine the relationship of several characteristics such as age, sex, BMI, comorbidities, genetics, and environmental factors for a clinical outcome of interest. For example, researchers have found that the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene controls the rapid growth and spread of breast cancer and have developed HER2 protein blocking medical products such as trastuzumab1. With the availability of electronic health record data, longitudinal data (repeated data collection on same respondents over time) from clinical trials, together with efficient existing and newly-developed statistical modeling, enable better therapeutic outcomes and contribute to personalized medicine. The health care industry has highly adopted these subgroup analysis methods in the recent past, to understand the efficacy and survival of patients with a new drug in consideration.  Some of the subgroup analysis methods that are of essential value in the literature includes FiveStar method, VirtualTwins, PRISM among others. The FDA has recently published a regulation (21CFR813, subpart H) that allows the use of PFS or other surrogate clinical endpoints other than survival or irreversible morbidity in the accelerated approval of new drugs for serious or life-threatening illnesses. Along with finding an association of essential features with the outcome, most phase 3 clinical trials use progression free survival as the surrogate endpoint in disease areas such as oncology,  readmission, predicting the course of Alzheimer’s disease, getting ahead of the surgery outcomes, and deterioration of patients in ICU. Hospitals under Medicare’s Hospital Readmissions Reduction program2 must ensure unplanned readmission to avoid penalties, reduce cost and resources. Statistics form the core for such machine learning and predictive algorithms guiding clinicians in disease diagnosis and therapeutic development. According to a survey, these algorithms have been adapted in about 60% of the healthcare industry. Once a drug passes through phase 1, and 2 of the clinical trial process, the newly developed compound is tested against comparative treatment/ placebo and progression free survival is an essential endpoint where the survival of patients is compared before and after initiation of the treatment.  Weibull regression has been widely used in modelling progression free survival. Bayesian shrinkage priors has been a successful variable selection technique. Here the presentations are focused on to capture a unified approach of subgroup analysis with penalized weibull regression through shrinkage priors. Further the utility based methods and non-parametric approaches their application in clinical trials are also discussed. Through this session, we aim to bring together the best of both worlds by combining statistical knowledge and concepts of variable selection (i) identifying new challenges in research (ii) providing a platform for interdisciplinary discussions and (iii) help shape future directions for understanding the pathway of its utility in clinical research. The session will have four confirmed presentations actively involved in developing statistical methodologies and applying such models to understand the fundamentals of subgroup analysis It will facilitate floor discussion and exchange of new ideas and cross-domain knowledge transfer.  Organiser:Arinjita Bhattacharyya  Chair:Arinjita Bhattacharyya  Speaker: Arinjita Bhattacharyya  Speaker: Riten Mitra ",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/361/details/

David Banks is from the USA, Nathaniel Stevens is Canadian, Hongxia Yang is Chinese. David Banks is fairly senior, the other speakers are relatively junior---Nathaniel is an Assistant Professor. Hongxia Yang works industry. Justification: Computational advertising refers to all the processes involved in determining when to display an on-line ad, how to display it, and what to show. It is estimated to account for $566 billion dollars in the U.S. economy alone, and that figure is growing rapidly, and all over the world. It is changing the way commerce works.  Google runs 50 to 200 adaptive designed experiments at a time, and Facebook (Meta) runs tens of thousands of experiments---most of these aim at finding the most compelling ads for fine-grained demographic groups. Ads become stale over time, so process monitoring techniques are pertinent. One needs predictive analytics to decide which ad to show to a user, and that often requires a sophisticated model to estimate the probability of click-through. Spatio-temporal models are relevant; e.g., ads for pizza are more effective at certain times of the day and in certain parts of the world. Marketing based on dynamic pricing poses optimization problems that can be addressed through dynamic programming. Statisticians have much to contribute to the theory and practice of computational advertising. Our profession needs to become more engaged. David Banks:  This is an overview of the complex ecosystem of modern on-line advertising.  It will focus on the statistics behind different kinds of recommender systems, as well as topics related to process monitoring of ad success, clickthrough prediction, and optimal contract fulfillment. Nathaniel Stevens:  On-line advertisers run hundreds of designed experiments today.  These experiments can be quite complex multiarmed bandits that gain millions of data points within a few minutes.  But there are new challenges that arise from interactions among so many experimental arms, incomplete information about users, and explore-exploit tradeoffs. Hongxia Yang:  Artificial intelligence has reached or surpassed human standards in the perceptual intelligence fields such as ""listening, speaking, and seeing"", but it is still in its infancy in the field of cognitive intelligence that requires external knowledge, logical reasoning, or domain migration. After long-term exploration and verification of large-scale online businesses such as Taobao and Alipay, we have built a ""super brain"" through the extremely large scale pre-training model M6, and built ""flexible limbs"" through the edge-cloud collaboration platform Gemini, to fully present the comprehensive picture of the next generation of AI. The 10 trillion M6 is currently the world’s largest pre-training model, achieving the industry’s ultimate low-carbon efficiency. Compared to GPT-3, M6 uses only 1% of the energy consumption which greatly promotes the development of ubiquitous AI. This year, M6 supported the world's largest shopping festival Double 11 for the first time. Relying on its multi-modal understanding ability, M6 greatly improved search and recommendation accuracy of Taobao and Alipay; with its smooth writing ability, M6 created scripts and copywriting for Tmall virtual streamers; depending on its generated high-definition images, M6 has been on duty in Rhino Intelligent Manufacturing and increased the efficiency of designers by 5 times. We developed Gemini, the industry's first edge-cloud collaborative learning framework with the definition of five paradigms: cloud, edge, cloud-centric, edge-centric, and edge-cloud collaboration learning modes. It not only protects data privacy, but also has outstanding performances in personalized recommendations. This talk we will include details of state-of-the-art recommendation system in practice, M6 and Gemini.

                 Karen Kafadar ","Join us for an insightful session with Karen Kafadar, who will deliver the IASC President's Lecture at the upcoming ISI World Statistical Congress. Today's massive datasets make statistical computing and displays even more needed than when the terms ""Statistical Computing"" and ""Statistical Graphics"" evolved as disciplines 50 years ago. Because the central goals of data analysis are insight and inference, and because rarely should all data be displayed, we need algorithms and data displays that meet both these objectives.  Further, `big data' are even more likely to require robust techniques, due to exotic values, outliers, or mixtures of distributions. Finally, more data does not imply more confidence, especially when they are non-representative of their target populations. Robust statistical methods are essential to these displays, in sampling the dataset, estimating key quantities, and communicating insights and inferences. This talk will discuss some recently developed displays that demonstrate that statistical methods in the `data science' era remain critical for  analyzing `big data.'   (This talk is based on joint work with Jordan Rodu.)   Organiser:Prof. Ying Chen Chair:Dr Christophe Croux Speaker:PROF.

                 PROF. DR. M. Alejandra Sorto ","Students in the United States can start their exposure to statistical concepts as early as second grade. Often the scope and emphasis of these ideas are guided by national or local standards and facilitated by teachers. Both standards and teacher education are, for the most part, behind the trends of the discipline. Scholars in the area of statistics teacher education are challenged by trying to align research agendas and teacher preparation programs that respond to new trends. In this presentation, we will examine current student and teacher standards and argue that although statistics and data science are ‘friends,’ they fight for space in a crowded curriculum. In addition, empirical data will be presented to argue that secondary teachers are emerging as competent statistics educators but are still learning the discipline and how to teach it. Hence, the current times pose the following questions that the field must address: 1) What is the relationship between statistics and data science for curriculum development at the school level? 2) What should be the focus of teaching-learning with respect to statistics and data science? 3) Should we change student and teacher standards to reflect the new needs? 4) Who should take the leadership of these changes? Proposed answers to these questions will be presented as a way to motivate deeper conversations. Organiser: PROF. DR. Ayse Aysin Bilgin Chair: PROF. DR. Ayse Aysin Bilgin Speaker: PROF. DR. M.

The Speaker is Professor Fulvia Mecatti, Dipartimento di Sociologia e Ricerca Sociale, Università Milano Bicocca, Italy. She will present a paper on What is big in big data: a sampling statistician perspective. Data integration and ML based estimation methods cited in the paper as well as the relevance of big data in producing statistical results will be discussed by Professor David Haziza, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Ottawa, Canada and by Dr. Diego Zardetto, Senior Statistician, Data Production and Methods Unit of the World Bank’s Development Data Group. What is big in big data: a sampling statistician perspective BigData users and BigData research community are fast growing bigger and bigger while statisticians at large seem to be growing divided between enthusiastic and worried, when not downright hostile. Is BigData also a big step ahead to extract information and actual knowledge from data? Is BigData underplaying statistical inference as we know it? Supplanting stats methodology as a low-cost futuristic option? As a (mainly) sampling statistician, in this talk Prof. Fulvia Mecatti shall try to decipher the multifaceted relationship connecting BigData to statistical and to sampling methodology, starting with the still blurry definition of BigData and discussing some very personal considerations and views.

                 Prof. Nicholas Fisher ","“It can hardly be doubted that Noah, when he saw a fine fish rising out of reach to right or left of the Ark's line of drift, would have given a lot to have been able to control its direction, and Noah's wish has certainly been echoed and re-echoed by those of our lake fishermen who, from necessity or choice, fish without a boatman.”
In this manner, William Sealy Gosset, in the guise of STUDENT, chose to lead into one of his lesser-known articles, published in 1936, about how an angler might manage the relationship between his raft and the currents in a lake. Indeed, the need to manage a relationship occurs in many workplace settings, and in turn may imply the need to measure the relationship. This presentation reviews some of the issues that arise in the process of finding meaningful relationship measures, using as an example the problem of how to rate universities.  When viewed through the lens of relationship measurement and management, all the major World University Ranking systems appear to have significant inadequacies. We present a “thought experiment” that purports to satisfy reasonable requirements for such systems.   Organiser: Dr Daniel Jeske Speaker: Prof. Nicholas Fisher",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/573/details/

Professor Michael L. Stein is a Distinguished Professor at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. Stein’s book has had and continues to have a profound impact on spatial statistics, most prominently in theory, but also methodology and applications. Its influence extends beyond spatial statistics into other areas in which Gaussian processes are prominently used, including machine learning and computer experiments. Despite being published over 20 years ago, references to the book, currently more than 4000 citations, are at their peak and have even increased in each of the last 4 years. It is broadly cited not just in the statistics and machine learning literatures, but also in a wide range of scholarly journals in disciplines including the geosciences, physics, chemistry, engineering, marketing, ecology and epidemiology. This book has fundamentally transformed spatial statistics and statistical applications of Gaussian processes, and its far-reaching impact will continue for years to come. It richly deserves the recognition of ISI Founders of Statistics Prize.   Organiser:Mrs Olivia van Dijck-Timbol Chair:Prof. Kerrie Mengersen Speaker:Michael L Stein",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/579/details/

However, not every environmental study entails a large data set: many applications ranging from astronomy or paleo-climatology have a high associated sampling cost and are instead well explained by physics-informed partial differential equations. Throughout the past few years, a new and powerful paradigm has emerged in the machine learning literature, merging data-driven and physics-informed problems, hence providing a unified framework for a whole spectrum of problems ranging from data-rich/context-poor to data-poor/context-rich. In this talk, I will present this new framework and discuss some of the most recent efforts to reformulate it as a stochastic model-based approach, thereby allowing calibrated uncertainty quantification.

                 Luna Hidalgo","The growing need for disaggregated statistics for specific geographic areas and small groups of the population has gained increased attention in National Statistical Offices in Latin America. Small Area Estimation (SAE) procedures methods can adequately fulfill these needs; these techniques allow for achieving accuracy and precision beyond the limits imposed by household survey samples, and direct estimators. Many countries in Latin America have begun to use SAE techniques to provide official statistics on several topics, for example, unemployment and poverty. This session, organized by the Division of Statistics of UN-ECLAC, will present some regional advances in the use of SAE methods to obtain disaggregated estimates through the integration of different data sources (surveys, administrative records censuses, and satellite imagery). The session will have presentations on methodologies, tools, and national experiences in producing disaggregated statistics using SAE techniques and transforming SAE from experiment to official data production. The session will cover the next four talks: 1. The PNAD Contínua is the largest household survey in Brazil and the source of the main sociodemographic and labour force indicators. Even collecting data from more than 600,000 people per quarter, the sample size is not always sufficient to disclose figures, such as indicators related to SDG 4, in domains needed by the policymakers. Thus, the main objective of this study is to provide an SAE for educational indicators, using PNAD Contínua data, in order to fill that gap. 2. Peru is divided into ~2000 districts, and each one of them has a local authority conducting social policy. Thus SAE turns out to be an incredibly helpful tool for evidence-based policymaking. In this talk, we will present how SAE and Machine Learning techniques have been used to derive novel indicators related to pressing problems in the country: vulnerability to poverty and children's anaemia. 3. Quarterly unemployment estimates for the Brazilian Labour Force Survey using state-space models in small areas. The study aims to produce quarterly estimates of unemployment for small areas inside the Brazilian states based on time series models for repeated surveys. This application allows the production of seasonally adjusted series and difference indicators taking to account the sampling error. 4. Based on the new Multiple deprivation index for Latin American countries produced by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, this talk shows the case study of Colombia to obtain small area estimates. This country counts with a recent population census providing most of the information required to compute the multiple deprivation index in small domains.

                 Joanne Yoon","This session invites practitioners and researchers to present research on challenges related to the innovative application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for the production of official statistics. Official statistics are traditionally produced using structured data, often produced by conducting surveys. In the past decades, these have been complemented with register and administrative data sources. More recently, by applying innovative data science techniques (e.g. NLP) on unstructured data (e.g. text) statistical offices are creating new, mostly experimental, statistics. There is more data available, and previously hard-to-analyze unstructured texts (web pages, social media, …) now become usable with use of NLP (amongst other techniques) in a timely and frequent way Furthermore, the field of NLP is rapidly evolving resulting in ever-increasing opportunities to extract information from unstructured texts. However, given the novelty of many NLP methods and underlying data sources, statistical institutes must be careful to ensure the quality of resulting statistics and hence need to invest in more systematic knowledge about their quality. Topics of interest in this session are, but are not limited to: Quality frameworks and quality metrics for NLP applications in official statistics; Applications of NLP on new data sources: social media data, web scraped data, ....;  Applications of Supervised classification of texts: sentiment analysis, automatic categorization of companies, product classification, ... ; Applications of Unsupervised knowledge extraction from texts and Visualisation of textual data. The following speakers will shed light on these topics by presenting their work on applying NLP in official statistics:    Statistics Canada (Roshanafshar Shirin), on “Classifying Respondent Comments from Canadian Census of Population”   Central Bureau of Statistics, Netherlands (Piet Daas), on “Categorizing company websites”  INEGI, Mexico (Jael Perez), on ""Methodological proposal to codify records of occupation and economic activity of the National Survey of Household Income and Expenses (ENIGH), using Deep Learning"".  Statistics Flanders, Belgium (Michael Reusens), on “Challenges on using Twitter sentiment in official statistics”  Statistics Poland (Dominik Dabrowski), on “Extracting meaningful information from web data on real estate – challenges and experiences from the Web Intelligence Network”     Organiser:Dr Michael Reusens  Chair:Dr Michael Reusens  Speaker:Dr Cedric De Boom  Speaker:PROF.

On the one hand, they produce statistics on a wide variety of domains, especially the financial system, that are of key relevance for a broad range of economic policymakers. On the other hand, central banks make extensive use of diverse data sources in pursuing their objectives, especially their monetary policy and financial stability goals. Both roles demand constant attention to the economic and financial environment and the fitness-for-purpose of statistics and analytical tools and products. This session will provide an opportunity to review central banks’ evolving use cases in leveraging on statistics to support the conduct of their policies.

The use of administrative, third-party, and opportunity data are rapidly being expanded, making surveys just one among several sources of data in the toolbox for creating data products for the public. We now have the opportunity to address long-standing measurement issues with the goal to accurately measure changes in society, solve the challenge of historically undercounted populations, and make official statistics more inclusive and timelier. One proposed paradigm shift in the United States is to create data products focused on purpose and use, such as understanding changing employment patterns during the pandemic, or changing migration patterns due to climate events. The scaffold for this shift is currently being developed at the U.S. Census Bureau, in the form of a unified statistical frame that integrates the individual frames into a collective whole. Similarly, the pillars of the Canadian paradigm focus on user-centric service delivery, leading-edge methods and data integration, statistical capacity building, and sharing and collaboration with a variety of partners. Finally, an exciting new area that addresses societal goals is using statistics to measure progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals. The roadmap developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) on statistics for SDGs is instructive about how locally relevant statistics can be developed – worldwide – going forward. Incorporation of these transformational approaches can serve to improve the representation of all groups and advance equity. The discussants are well-poised to comment on how this can be achieved, providing a path to better inform societal goals.

Whereas climate-scenarios always consider population trends in their hypothesis, today the contrary is not necessarily the case. This session aims at bringing together experts from demography, climate and public health research to discuss the feasibility and relevance of climate-sensitive population scenarios. Population projections produced by public institutions – be they national, regional, or global – find broad consideration in society. They rely on observed data on population trends and hypothesis concerning the future evolution of society, influencing demographic events. The hypothesis flowing in population scenarios thus have to account for all major societal and environmental developments that may affect the population. In this regard, researchers increasingly highlight the necessity for demographers to more explicitly address the ongoing changes of the natural environment and the world climate when projecting population, by an interdisciplinary approach (Muttarak 2021, Van Dalen and Henkens 2021, Lutz 2017). Whereas climate-scenarios always consider population trends in their hypothesis, today the contrary is not necessarily the case. This invited paper session wants to bring together experts from demography, climate and public health research in order to discuss the following questions: 1. Where does international demographic research stand in taking into account climate change impact on population trends? 2. To what extent is it pertinent and possible to model evolutions in such highly complex systems – for the world or for specific regions or countries? What can be the role of SSPs in this context?  3. How can international and national official statistics take into account climate change in their population projections? What is the relevance of this for fact-based policy-making? The results of this session’s presentations and discussions should give orientation to NSOs and other public institutions dealing with population projections. This session is organized within the framework of the Unlocking the Power of Data Initiative, a project launched by the Swiss Confederation to expand the dialogue on data and statistics to stakeholders beyond the data and statistics communities and deepen knowledge. This session will mark the launch of the Workstream on Population Projections and Climate Change. While population development is taken into account in climate scenarios, climate change is not yet included in population projections, although it has already shown implications for human life and migration. As such, this workstream will seek to lead critical discussions on the relevance and possibility of developing climate-sensitive population scenarios and illustrate interactions between different areas of the 2030 Agenda.   Organiser: Vjollca Simoni Chair: Johanna Probst  Speaker:Raya Muttarak  Speaker: Leiwen Jiang Discussant: John Wilmoth Discussant: Tammy Glazer Discussant: Samir K.C",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/297/details/

By showcasing recent research that draws on census microdata available through the IPUMS International database, this session makes a case for continued adherence to open data practices in the area of census and survey microdata dissemination. IPUMS International is the world's largest collection of population microdata available for research. More than 100 countries have joined in partnership with IPUMS as part of their census (and survey) microdata dissemination efforts. IPUMS facilitates researcher access to important census microdata by
- standardizing disparate data formats;
- harmonizing data at the variable level across time and across countries according to international standard classifications where possible,
- ensuring long term data preservation according to best practices in data archiving,
- curating and optimizing documentation from questionnaires, enumerator instructions and sample documentation; - managing and vetting credentials of data requesters; and
- disseminating data through a user friendly web system that provides customized data extracts to eligible members of the research community.
The goal is to facilitate comparative and cross-temporal international research. In pursuing this goal, IPUMS does not reduce international differences to a set of least common denominators but aims to provide researchers access to the full detail of the original data. The database includes more than 1 billion person records across 400+ censuses from 104 countries. The IPUMS samples are nationally representative and typically offer geographic detail to the second administrative level within countries, such as counties, districts, or municipalities. More than 100 thousand registered researchers from academic and government institutions worldwide access microdata files, including international and US census and survey data, from IPUMS. This session illustrates the ways that providing access to census microdata fuels scholarly research. Our panel members will present results from their recent research using census microdata shared by more than 100 countries. The data are accessible and optimized for research use through the IPUMS database. The papers cover a variety of topics, including migration and living standards; educational attainment and mobility; creation of an urban area database; and trends in family living arrangements. Each presentation will highlight why census microdata are uniquely suited to the research agenda. Discussion will focus on how and why continued access to population representative data are crucial for advancing knowledge about human populations and activities. Authors and the discussant will also describe data features and detail which ensure robust analysis and sound findings.

by Lovaton Davila and Sarkar
This study examines spatial variability in living standards and inequality at the place of origin and destination as push or pull factors for internal migration. Using census microdata samples from 3 census rounds in each of four Latin American countries and a living standards index based on household asset information consistently available in the censuses, results indicate that migration flows increase with living standards at origin and destination, as well as inequality at the place of origin. The Geography of Intergenerational Mobility in Latin America & the Caribbean
by Munoz Saavedra
This research estimates intergenerational mobility in education using data from 91 censuses that span 24 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean over half a century, disaggregated nearly 400 “provinces” and more than 6,000 “districts.” Results are heterogeneous but suggest overall that the level of mobility is highly correlated with the share of primary completion of the previous generation. There is also evidence of a declining trend in the mobility gap between urban and rural populations, and small differences by gender. An Introduction to DUIA: The database of urban inequality and amenities
by Ramos and Uitermark
This article introduces DUIA, the Database on Urban Inequality and Amenities, which describes socio-economic development and amenities of 86 cities, mostly outside the West. The database is designed to address three concerns that have not been resolved by other databases on cities. Goals are 1) improved accuracy in the definition of city boundaries (using remote sensing data from the Atlas on Urban Expansion); 2) harmonized and disaggregated housing and population characteristics (drawing on IPUMS); and 3) ensuring transparency and replicability through use of open source software and script sharing. DUIA aims to lower barriers to the systematic study of inequality and amenities over time and across cities. Trends in family living arrangements, nuclear households, and development

                 Dr Sumonkanti Das ","In this session we will bring together researchers whose common goal is to model health outcomes at disaggregated geographic levels over extended time periods. Official statistics in the form of censuses and surveys are key to the small area estimation techniques used to do this. This session will investigate developments in Africa and Asia where the scarcity of data at sub-national levels is a frequent concern. It will also address developments in modelling that are occurring in Australia where disparities are an important issue, and set the scene for the future application of small area estimation and related methods. Good health and wellbeing is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals proposed by the UN as a shared vision of peace and prosperity for all. The second goal, good health and wellbeing for all, remains out of reach for many countries, particularly in developing countries. For instance, childhood malnutrition occurs when a child has poor quality and/or inadequate food. Tragically, while it is preventable, it has both short- and long-term detrimental effects. Almost half of childhood deaths are associated with malnutrition, and most of these occur in developing countries in Africa and Asia.
However, proper evaluation and monitoring of countries’ progress towards relies on the availability of good quality data. Unfortunately, many developing countries’ statistical systems struggle to provide accurate data. Notably, countries with poor data tend to be the same low-income countries with high rates of malnourished children. The scarcity of data is also an issue, with many developing countries incurring large gaps between surveys leading to the urgent need for methods to estimate in both the spatial and temporal dimension.
In developed countries such as Australia, the same problems arise in the context of disparities in health outcomes across large spatial scales. While Australia is one the richest countries in the world, and a majority experience good health, Indigenous communities in particular often experience hardship and health challenges. Furthermore, there are localised differences that lead to geographical and spatial variation in health outcomes.   
In this session we will address current efforts to monitor health outcomes using a variety of small area estimation techniques. Das will demonstrate the application of the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithm to estimate childhood malnutrition rates in spatio-temporal dimensions for Bangladesh. Aheto will demonstrate the integrated nested Laplace approach (INLA) for geo-statistical modelling of childhood mortality in Ghana. Hogg will bring the perspective of an early career researcher to the challenges of including risk factors in models at highly disaggregated levels. 
The discussants, Cramb and Baffour will address challenges and future direction for these models. Cramb will demonstrate how the Cancer Atlas of Australia not only estimates smoothed Bayesian models of cancer rates but also visualises them with measures of uncertainty. Baffour will place these and other small area estimation projects in the world context and point to future challenges and opportunities for small area estimation using Big Data.

                 Franck Cotton ","Organisations producing official statistics around the world are constantly innovating and modernising their statistical production. A key success factor in the modernisation of official statistics is to have common foundations to enable knowledge sharing, cooperation and joint innovation projects both within the organisation and across different organisations. To be able to talk about similarities in challenges, ideas and potential solutions, it is necessary to have a common language and understanding of the processes providing a frame for the production of official statistics. The so-called “ModernStats models” provide standard frameworks for the official statistical community in the UNECE region and beyond, and are developed, supported and promoted by different organisations and countries working together under the umbrella of the Conference of European Statisticians (CES). After the adoption of the Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM) by the international community in 2008 (joint UNECE/Eurostat/OECD work session on statistical metadata – METIS), various ModernStats models have been developed to address different challenges that the official statistics community faces. The suite of ModernStats models include the Generic Statistical Information Model (GSIM), the Generic Activity Model for Statistical Organizations (GAMSO), the Common Statistical Data Architecture (CSDA), the Common Statistical Production Architecture (CSPA) and many more; with new models such as the Core Ontology for Official Statistics (COOS) currently in development. These models not only provide a conceptual description of different aspects of statistical production but also function as anchors for implementation standards and models, most notably DDI and SDMX, to be used in the development of statistical data management solutions. The landscape of standards and solutions available for statistical organisations and other producers of official statistics has never been richer than it is today but it also complex and very often challenging. Any statistical organisation willing to find its way in this complex system will turn their attention to process and information models. The need for relevant guidance for official statistics in this regard is now higher than ever before, setting the course for the evolution of the ModernStats models. More and more countries and organisations are using the ModernStats models on the national level and in defining innovative ideas. The tendency of countries turning towards these standards for structure and guidance is evident seeing that scientific papers, innovative ideas and developments are quite often presented and explained in papers and at conferences with references made to these models. In order to support the official statistical community, it is essential to understand how ModernStats models help statistical organisations in their modernisation programmes. The session will give insight into the value and the statistical potential of these framework standards, show how they have evolved in the last 15 years and reflect on how the statistical community behind these models will ensure that the models will remain relevant considering the challenges for official statistics in the future. The session will provide: (1) insight into the relevance and added value of the ModernStats standards and the accompanying tools for the modernisation of official statistics in the rapidly changing data ecosystem; (2) guidance on how the ModernStats models can help statistical organisations use a common language and understanding of their systems and the challenges of interoperability; (3) overview of recent developments and current statistical challenges in scope for the future of the models.

The process was very challenging as it aimed to not only ensure that the proposed global indicators are technically sound, robust, and address all SDGs and targets, but also preserve the political balance, integration and ambition contained in the 2030 Agenda.   The global indicator framework was agreed by the UN Statistical Commission as a starting point for monitoring the SDGs in March 2016 and later adopted by the General Assembly on 6 July 2017. At the adoption, there were 232 unique indicators and more than one-third of indicators were tier III indicators, meaning that no established methodology or standards are available for the indicator or methodology/standards are being developed or tested for the indicator.  The IAEG-SDGs has worked intensively over the years on the implementation of the indicator framework, in collaboration with national statistical offices (NSOs), custodian agencies, academia and civil society.   As a result, there were no tier III indicators after the 2020 Comprehensive Review process.  Considerable progress has also been made in the availability of internationally comparable data for SDG monitoring, with the number of indicators included in the global SDG database increasing from 115 indicators in 2016 to 217 in 2022.   Halfway through the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the IAEG-SDGs and partners will continue to work on the full implementation of the indicator framework at global, regional, national, and local levels to support the realization of the SDGs.  The continued efforts will need to build national capacity for monitoring the SDGs and incorporating data innovations.   This also includes the 2025 comprehensive review of the indicator framework to further refine and improve the monitoring framework.   The session will bring speakers from national statistical offices (NSOs), international organizations and academia to:  •Review lessons learned and challenges in the development and implementation of the global SDG indicator framework •Discuss how the SDG monitoring process has helped push the methodology development of measuring many development areas that were new to the statistical community  •Share experiences of NSOs in adopting the global SDG indicator framework to develop national SDG indicators Organiser:Yongyi Min  Chair:Yongyi Min  Speaker:Mr Leonardo Trujillo Oyola Speaker:Dr Stephen MacFeely  Speaker: Omar Seidu Speaker: Ms. Sara Frankl  Discussant: Ms Cara Williams   ",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/295/details/

The continuum may concerns the time or space but not only. In some situations the continuum may come from multiple sources. Consequently, a statistical unit may be a curve, a surface or any more complex mathematical object presenting some continuum feature. Such hi-tech data are called functional data, where the word ""functional"" is the natural mathematical concept for handling continuum. The challenge is simple: extracting relevant information from datasets containing collections of curves, or surfaces or any other complex objects, often combined with standard multivariate variables. All methodologies dealing with such functional data are gathered under the terminology Functional Data Analysis (FDA). The success of this exciting modern area of Statistics is mainly due to its ability to solve major engineering challenges coming from modern domains of applications (biology, biomechanics, chemometrics, econometrics, environmental management, geophysics, medical sciences, industry, etc) while raising new fundamental statistical issues. Five outstanding experts of the Functional Data Analysis community will present the high potentialities of statistical methodologies involving Functional Data Analysis with a special attention on practical developments. The main goal of this session is to reach a wide audience by presenting a set of interesting applications demonstrating the usefulness of functional data analysis.

Members of the ISBIS, IASC, and the ISI SIG on Data Science will be particularly interested in the talks and discussion of the IPS. [This session if co-organized by Carlos Trucíos and Paulo Canas Rodrigues.]   Title 1: Robust Estimation of High-Dimensional cDCC Models Authors: Eduardo Gabriel Pinheiro (Murabei Data Science) and  Luiz K. Hotta - Speaker  (University of Campinas). Abstract: Volatility plays an important role in many economic and financial applications and the number of assets has increased considerably in recent years. The cDCC model has been one of the most commonly used models and composite likelihood has been used to estimate  high-dimensional cases. The paper shows that this estimator can be strongly affected by additive outliers, one of the most frequent types of outliers. A robust method is proposed and it is shown that its performance is better than that of the traditional nonrobust estimator both by simulation study and by backtesting  on real-life stock return data.   Title 2: Modelling and Forecasting Covariance Matrices: A Simple Model with Stochastic Volatility Latent Factors. Authors: Giorgio Calzolari (University of Florence) and Roxana Halbleib - Speaker (University of Freiburg). Abstract: This paper proposes a simple approach for forecasting large dimensional covariance matrices with the help of a latent factor structure with stochastic volatility components applied to realized covariance matrices. The factor structure together with the conditional Wishart distribution automatically assures positive-definiteness, symmetry and thick-tails, captures the commonality in the dynamics and the long-persistence of the autocorrelation of realized (co)variances within a unified parsimonious framework with no parameter constraints. The Factor Autoregressive model we propose profits from what alternatives suffer, namely the curse of dimensionality: higher the matrix dimension, higher the efficiency of the estimates and forecasts. The model has a non-Gaussian non-linear state-space representation that we estimate by maximum likelihood together with a non-Gaussian filtering technique. Monte Carlo simulations provide evidence for the accuracy of the estimates and the comprehensive empirical application to DJIA components proves the usefulness of the model to accurately forecast large dimensional covariance matrices.   Title 3: Modeling Multivariate Positive-Valued Time Series with Financial Applications. Authors: Nalini Ravishanker - Speaker (University of Connecticut), Chiranjit Dutta (University of Connecticut) and Sumanta Basu (Cornell University). Abstract: We describe and compare two approaches for Bayesian analysis of vector positive-valued time series, with application to analyzing financial data streams. The first approach consists of a flexible level correlated model (LCM) framework for building hierarchical models. The LCM framework allows us to combine marginal gamma distributions for the positive-valued component responses, while accounting for association among the components at a latent level. We use integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) for fast approximate Bayesian modeling via the R-INLA package, building custom functions to handle a latent vector AR model. The second approach builds a logarithmic vector multiplicative error model (log-vMEM) assuming multivariate Gamma errors, and imposing hierarchical lag structures to guarantee a  sparse model. This model will enable us to study dynamic interactions among different intraday volatility measures for different financial assets.   Title 4: Tail risk measures for ESG and nonESG companies. Authors: Alessandra Amendola - Speaker (University of Salermo) and Vincenzo Candila (University of Salermo). Abstract: The attention of the literature on the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) themes has enormously increased over the last few years. Nowadays, the consciousness toward social responsibility is grown up and has motivated the surge of new research lines, where the main differences among ESG and nonESG companies, concerning their economic and/or statistical indicators, became a relevant issue.
The main aim of the current proposal is to investigate the performances of ESG and nonESG indexes in terms of the resulting tail risk measures such as the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). Moreover, the impact of relevant predictors (macro-economic variables, implied volatility, etc.) in the effcient estimate of the sustainability indexes volatility and tail risk measures are investigated. Further issues related to vast dimensionality, mixed sampled frequency, asymmetric effects and co-movement are also addressed in this framework.   Title 5: Forecasting Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall in Large Panels: A Robust General Dynamic Factor Approach. Authors: Carlos Trucíos - Speaker (University of Campinas) and Marc Hallin (Université Libre de Bruxelles) Abstract: Beyond their importance from the regulatory policy point of view, risk measures such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) play an important role in risk management, portfolio allocation, capital level requirements, trading systems, and hedging strategies. However, due to the curse of dimensionality and the presence of extreme observations, their estimation and forecast in large portfolios is a difficult task. To overcome these problems, we propose a new procecedure based on filtered historical simulation, the general dyamic factor model and robust volatility models. The new procedure is applied in US stocks and the backtesting and scoring results indicate that both VaR and ES estimated using our proposal outperform several existing alternatives.   Organiser:Dr Carlos Trucios  Chair:Dr Paulo Canas Rodrigues  Speaker:Prof. Roxana Halbleib  Speaker:Prof. Alessandra Amendola  Speaker:Luiz Hotta  Speaker:Prof. Nalini Ravishanker  Speaker: Dr Carlos Trucios ",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/303/details/

Statistical literacy is a common objective for many stakeholders - National Statistical Offices, Schools, Universities, national associations and international networks and organizations – and they all have different advantages to offer. National Statistical Offices are concerned with the accurate use of official statistics and are particularly well placed to demonstrate the application of statistics in relation to public policy issues. They have direct communication lines with policy-makers, and in some cases with media representatives and business associations. The goal of Schools and Universities is to educate future generations, they have pedagogical expertise and work directly with kids and young people. A number of related initiatives led by teachers’ and academic associations brings innovative approaches and helps advocate for and mainstream statistics in primary, secondary and higher education. International networks and organizations help share knowledge across countries and promote the use of best practices. Specific set-ups and roles of the stakeholders would vary depending on a national landscape, as they may have different capacities, resources and networks. Working in partnerships offers an opportunity to amplify ongoing statistical literacy work and identify and jointly address gaps in meeting the specific needs of different target audiences. The session will be an opportunity to highlight the role of partnerships between Academia, NSOs, Schools and Associations to contribute to strengthening statistical literacy of the general public and specific target groups. A number of examples will be presented during the session by International Statistical Literacy Project from the countries it is working with; by Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística from Brazil; by University of KwaZulu-Natal on their Teachers4DaraAnalytics program; and by UN Statistics Division on the inventory of statistical literacy initiatives by the Global Network of Institutions for Statistical Training (GIST).

                 Erwin Diewert ","Over the last two decades, CPIs have become multi-source reliant statistics where prices are obtained not only from traditional price collection in the field but also from new data sources such as: scanner data; administrative data; and data from the Internet using web scraping techniques. Depending on the data source, different strategies can be adopted for constructing elementary aggregates and for compiling consumer price indices (CPIs). In particular, the widespread use of scanner data, which contain sales transaction information on prices paid, quantities purchased and product characteristics for all items of some outlets in a certain period of time, poses certain methodological demands on index methods. Multilateral index methods, such as the Gini, Eltetö, Köves and Szulc (GEKS), Geary Khamis (GK), the Time product Dummy (TPD) methods and spatial chaining methods, traditionally applied in the context of spatial price comparisons, have provided a solution to a number of problems encountered in the temporal context with bilateral methods. More specifically, multilateral methods allow to take into account all the products that are available in the different periods by also explicitly weighting each product according to its importance in each period. These methods have the potential to reduce the chain-drift associated with chained bilateral indices (De Haan and Van der Grient, 2011; Ivancic, Diewert and Fox, 2011). Given these advantages, multilateral index methods, have been recommended as suitable price index compilation methods for transaction data, despite their additional complexity compared with bilateral methods. Nevertheless, consensus on key issues has yet to be achieved. The use of multilateral index methods based on scanner data gives rise to an aggregation problem. Product specification has been recognized as a critical step that could jeopardize any gains in bias reduction that we would typically expect from using scanner data. While scanner data helps reducing lower-level substitution bias, other biases can appear because products are specified too tightly or too broadly. In addition, in a dynamic product universe, products may enter or exit with unusually high or low prices. It is known that this creates biases in traditional matched model methods and these biases propagate to multilateral index methods. Aggregation of prices or quantities when commodities disappear or appear has been regarded as one of the most difficult tasks (Lamboray, and Krsinich, 2015; Abe, Enda, Inakura and Tonogi 2015). There are a variety of multilateral indices which all share similar basic features, but can also give different estimates of price changes. At present there is no real consensus as to which combination of approaches is the best way to calculate a multilateral index (Diewert and Fox, 2022). In order to understand which multilateral method should be used to aggregate detailed price and quantity data an approach based on the definition of a “true” cost of living index may be adopted. In addition, indices have to be updated as new price data is collected and the only way to do this without affecting measures of past price changes is to splice multilateral index numbers calculated over different windows (time periods) together (Chessa, 2019). This reintroduces a limited amount of chain drift, albeit much smaller than that seen for traditional methods. The choice of window length also involves the tension, on the one hand, between using as much of the data as possible and, on the other, using only bilateral comparisons which are reliable. In the context of temporal comparison using multilateral indices, as time passes, recent price movements will be increasingly affected by prices and price changes in the distant past. This will result in a loss of “characteristicity”. Characteristicity, defined in the context of spatial comparisons (involving many countries and multilateral methods), requires that any set of multilateral comparisons satisfying the transitivity property should retain the essential features of the binary comparisons constructed without the transitivity requirement. An approach for solving this tension between the different levels of reliability of the bilateral indices is based on the weighted GEKS with alternative specifications of the matrix of weights based on how one may wish to measure reliability (Rao 1997, Rao and Timmer, 2003; Brunetti, Fatello, Laureti and Polidoro, 2022). The aim of the Session is to present, discuss and evaluate various methodological approaches with particular focus on: The best multilateral method to use by comparing alternative methods with some theoretical benchmark index; Methodology for extending the resulting series when new observations become available; Treatment of new and disappearing goods; Seasonality and chain drift; Use of different systems of weights for introducing information on the reliability of the underlying bilateral comparisons for the weighting matrix of GEKS method The session will be organized with the presentation of five papers. Then the floor will be opened for discussion by participants.   Title: “Multilateral methods and product specification” Authors: Claude Lamboray Affiliation: Eurostat and Statistics Luxemburg Speaker: Claude Lamboray Email: claude.lamboray@statec.etat.lu  Abstract/Short summary: Product specification has been recognized as a critical step that can have a significant impact on the results obtained with multilateral methods. Tightly specified products may cause a bias because there may not be sufficient product matches over time. Broadly specified products may cause a bias because there may be quality differences between the underlying transactions that make up the product. In this paper, we examine these biases in the context of multilateral methods and provide tentative guidance on which product specification to select in practice.   2)Title (tentative): Comparing index extension methods for multilateral methods Authors: Antonio Chessa Speaker: Antonio Chessa Affiliation: Statistics Netherlands CBS   Abstract/Short summary: Multilateral indices are transitive on a fixed time interval, but an essential question is how the drift-free properties can be preserved when data from the next period become available. The time window has to be adjusted in order to include new data. The indices calculated on the adjusted window may differ from the previously calculated indices, which, however, cannot be revised. Various methods have been suggested to overcome this issue but the behaviour of different methods still needs to be better understood. This paper will present the results of a comparative study of extension methods for index series.    3) Title: ""On the Aggregation of Commodities with Product Turnover"" Authors: Naohito Abe (Hitotsubashi University), Noriko Inakura (Osaka Sangyo University), DS Prasada Rao (University of Queensland), Akiyuki Tonogi (Hitotsubashi University) Speaker: Naohito Abe Affiliation: Hitotsubashi University Email: nabe@ier.hit-u.ac.jp  naohito.abe@gmail.com  Abstract/Short summary: Aggregation of prices or quantities when commodities disappear or appear has been regarded as one of the most difficult tasks. Product turnover occurs at various aggregation levels from commodity level scanner data, seasonal products such as fruits, to categorical aggregates such as foreign trips during the Covid19-pandemic. The current method to handle product turnovers is to use (1) chain indexes or (2) Feenstra's variety effects. Both methods are subject to chain drifts. In addition, the second method cannot be applied to aggregate level unless the elasticity of substitution is greater than unity. In this paper, we propose a method to aggregate prices and quantities with product turn overs that is free from chain drifts. While the standard Könus' cost of living assumes that the only supply shocks cause the changes in prices and quantities, our method can handle both demand and supply shocks. A procedure to decompose the actual changes into demand and supply shocks is also provided, which can be applied to various levels of aggregation, from scanner data to international comparisons.   4) Title: “Scanner Data and the Use of Multilateral Index Number Methods” Author: W. Erwin Diewert Speaker: W. Erwin Diewert Affiliation: University of British Columbia and University of New South Wales Email:  erwin.diewert@ubc.ca Abstract/Short summary: The paper looks at the use of multilateral index number methods to address the chain drift problem that arises when scanner data is aggregated. The chain drift problem arises in the context of price and quantity data that is subject to frequent fluctuations due to either dynamic pricing (i.e., sale prices occur frequently) or to seasonal fluctuations. A multilateral index number method which looks very promising is a method that links periods based on how similar the structure of prices and quantities is when constructing bilateral indexes linking the data for two periods.    5) Title (tentative) On the use of weighted GEKS and TPD for the calculation of consumer price indices Authors: Tiziana Laureti (University of Tuscia), Federico Polidoro (Istat) and Prasada DS Rao (The University of Queensland) Speaker: Tiziana Laureti Affiliation: University of Tuscia  Email: laureti@unitus.it Abstract/Short summary: The paper focuses on the analysis of the properties of the weighted GEKS, based on superlative bilateral indexes, and Weighted Time Product Dummy methods for computing CPIs using scanner data. Different alternative systems of weights are considered for introducing information on the reliability of the underlying binaries for the weighting matrix.  We also compare the different methods with a theoretical benchmark index based on the calculation of a target “true” cost of living index under the hypothesis of Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) purchaser preferences.

The Proposed session will be of considerable interest to many WSC attendees and especially to official statisticians from national statistical agencies across the world who are currently using or considering the use of electronic point-of-sales scanner data from retail outlets for computing their Consumer Price Index (CPIs). Price paid by consumers can now be observed at the point-of-sale across many products at high frequency, potentially allowing NSIs to, for example, to compile and publish reliable measures of monthly or even weekly measures of price change. However, there is has been no consensus on the most suitable method for calculating price indices with high frequency transactions data, such as scanner data. Scanner data have the potential for improving the timeliness of Consumer Price Index (CPI) releases and the ability to better capture changes in consumer expenditure patterns during pandemics and other crises. Conventional fixed basket price indexes are ill-suited for this task as they are not able to capture rapid product turnover thus becoming quickly unrepresentative of consumer spending patterns, while chained indices often report excessive and unrealistic price changes, and suffer from ‘chain drift’. Multilateral price index numbers, designed primarily for the purpose of spatial (regional as well as cross-country) price comparisons, have been advocated as a possible solution to the problem of chain drift and especially for treatment of scanner data. However, there are many multilateral index methods for NSIs to choose from and many choices to make when applying them, including sampling designs, product specifications, splicing methods to extend these indices when data from new time periods are added. Recently, Eurostat published a guide, “Multilateral Methods in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices” to support countries in understanding and implementing multilateral methods in the context of the HICP (Eurostat, 2020). Given the current state of developments with respect to data availability and choice of index number methods, there is an urgent need to examine the issues involved and provide advice and recommendations to national statistical offices.  The proposed session brings together experts working in this field with the aim of evaluating alternative methods to handle high-frequency price data and provide recommendations to practitioners. Outstanding questions like those illustrated above need to be resolved if national statistical agencies are to take maximum advantage of the data revolution.   Organiser:Prof. Tiziana Laureti  Chair:PROF.

 18 July 2023,Tuesday,10:00,12:00,"IPS 489 - The basic infrastructures of official statistics – challenges, experiences, and opportunities, with a particular focus on the last round of censuses",IPS Room 213,Category: IPS,The new infrastructure emerging from the 2020 round of population and housing censuses, Mr Jean-Michel Durr ,"  The basic statistical infrastructure comprises the languages, standards, systems, tools, methods, and statistical frames necessary to produce official statistics. This infrastructure can be understood as a set of specific intangible assets of the official statistics system. This infrastructure is of fundamental importance for the functioning of the official statistics system and the credibility of the statistics produced because regardless of the undertaken activities and efforts related to conducting statistical surveys, deficiencies in the infrastructure and weakness of the foundations on which they are based may constitute a significant obstacle to the effective and sustainable achievement of goals. Traditionally, the principles of official statistics adopted by the UN are discussed when debating fundamental issues. However, the success of a statistical system is primarily determined not only by internal factors but equally by its environment, public infrastructure in a broader sense, the quality of public institutions, social cohesion, social ties, the effectiveness of democratic processes, and the quality of human resources. Although less frequently discussed, these issues are of great importance for the functioning of the official statistics system, not only in developing countries. It is worth noting that the official statistics itself is the state's information infrastructure, which brings enormous responsibility and servitude to society. The census forms a particular foundation of the statistical infrastructure. The time after the last wave of censuses encourages the discussion on its course and the implications on the critical infrastructure of official statistics. A new context for these discussions is given by the dynamic development of complex information environments and data ecosystems, the eruption of potential new data sources, and related issues of policy processes aimed at organizing data governance, safeguarding adequate privacy protection, and data processing control. Such a rapidly changing, increasingly complex environment is a multidimensional challenge for official statistics, which must continuously adapt language and activities, absorb new concepts, and redefine the meaning of previous ones. There seem to be, however, not enough discussion about the quality and sustainability of infrastructure and its foundations.   The session aims to discuss these issues through an open exchange of views and discussions. it will bring together speakers from the national statistical offices, academia, and international organizations. We will encourage participants to:  - discuss issues of maturity and professional independence of official statistics systems in tense political contexts;  - share views on the role of the institutional environment of official statistics and its impact on its functioning;  - discuss the recent wave of censuses, focusing mainly on new challenges and achievements for the essential infrastructure for statistical production;  - review progress in enhancing the geospatial dimension of statistical data, focusing on recent developments and challenges;  - discuss the role of experimental research in the development of official statistics  - discuss the use and misuse of data in uncertain economic and social conditions Organiser:Prof. Dominik Rozkrut  Chair:Prof. Dominik Rozkrut  Speaker:Mr Jean-Michel Durr  Speaker:Mr Stefan Schweinfest  Speaker:Mrs Linda Peters  Discussant: Misha Belkindas   ",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/292/details/

                 Prof. Suhail Doi ","Research synthesis (i.e. systematic review and meta-analysis) is the integration of existing knowledge and is the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine, exerting major influence in shaping public health policy and clinical practice, as it resolves seemingly contradicting research findings pertinent to a topic. However, some methodological limitations and challenges in research synthesis urgently need to be addressed to enable timely and high-quality evidence-based practice. In this IPS session, we will discuss limitations of current methods and provide robust alternatives.   Limitation 1: We are in the era of information explosion, with over 10,000 publications indexed per day in Scopus. As a result, well-conducted systematic reviews are often time-consuming (6 months to 2 years) and resource-intensive (up to $200,000). Such long periods are often not practical, when policymakers need timely evidence for decisions that could have huge social, economic, and health implications.   Limitation 2: Research synthesis aims to compile all available evidence; however, in practice, researchers frequently face studies that report the same outcome differently, such as a continuous variable (e.g., scores for rating depression) or a binary variable (e.g., counts of patients with depression dichotomized by certain latent, unreported depression scores). Current methods to combine binary and continuous outcomes may be inaccurate when effect sizes are large or cut-off values for dichotomizing binary events are extreme.   Limitation 3: Randomised controlled trials are often not powered to assess safety outcomes and adverse events. Meta-analysis can increase the power; however, data extraction errors can have an impact on the pool estimates. Currently, it is unknown what are the extents, most common mistakes, and the impact of data extraction errors on recommendations of safety outcome meta-analyses.   Limitation 4: Meta-analysis is often used to synthesise proportions including estimates of disease frequency like incidence or prevalence. In order to obtain better approximation of such data to the normal distribution, researchers use variance-stabilizing transformations including logit, arcsine-square-root, or Freeman–Tukey double-arcsine transformations. Despite the increasing usage, researchers have expressed concerns about the performance of the various transformations.   To address these limitations, in this session we will  1.present robust rapid synthesis approaches by limiting the inclusion of studies by year or publication and number of publications, and the trade-off between workload and precision of point estimates of these approaches; 2.present a Bayesian hierarchical model for combining standardized mean differences and odds ratios in the same meta-analysis; 3.report findings of a large reproducibility study identifying the most common types of errors, the impact of these errors in pooled estimates, and provide recommendations to reduce data extraction error;  4.report findings of simulation studies using MCMC method for estimating the performance of the natural estimator, logit transformed estimator, and Freeman-Tukey double arcsine estimator.

                 Mrs Orietta Luzi ","The statistical production process heavily relies on (statistical) computing throughout all process steps. Historically, ‘official’ software tools were developed and maintained by development units within IT departments, while much processing was automated ‘under the radar’ by users using for example the programmability of office tools and batch scripts. This user-driven automation took off further with the introduction of capable workstation statistic software packages such as SAS and SPSS and is now changing even more rapidly with the usage of powerful open-source such as R or Python. Nowadays, these open-source tools are not limited to basic statistical tasks. They live in a rich ecosystem with professional software engineering features including libraries, (unit) testing and documentation standards, CI facilities, and so on. Current (open source) statistical tools have capabilities that go far beyond simple, stand-alone scripts and currently offer the ability to build services, web applications, or standalone applications that integrate with a modern IT infrastructure and thereby also can play an important role to make production systems more cost efficient. As a consequence, decentralized script writing that has typically been permitted rather than sanctioned and supported in statistical organizations is rapidly transforming into professional software engineering. However, we still see that Statistical Organizations have to come to terms with this new reality. Decentralized software engineering means that allowing script writing is not enough: support is needed in the areas of HR management, IT infrastructure, and planning and organization of statistical production processes. In this session, we cover the topic of computing in the statistical office from four different perspectives, each presented in a 10 minute presentation. The topic is introduced (5min) by the discussant and after the presentation a panel discussion is chaired by the discussant with input from the discussant and the audience. Culture transformation and democratization of programming (Kate Burnett-Isaacs) Statistics Canada is using data science and modern analytics as key methods to provide more value in the products and services it delivers to Canadians. Statistics Canada has been on a journey of adopting R and Python into its mainstream statistical processes since 2020. Fully integrating these open source technologies and associated modern methods into the day-to-day production pipelines of official statistics is more than just technology, it requires a cultural transformation. Statistics Canada approached open source adoption by providing the tools, support and resources to programmers from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines that extend beyond traditional roles. This cultural shift is being driven intentionally with intersecting pillars that include new governance models, partnerships and employee empowerment. This presentation outlines the critical role that democratizing programming has played in incorporating open source into production, the contributions of governance, partnerships, people and investment to effect this transformation, the progress achieved so far and the lessons learned along the way. Computational competencies and skills of the modern statistician (Mark van der Loo) Computing with data is at the heart of the statistical office. Yet, the area of technical computing often falls between the two stools of data analysts and IT developers. In this presentation I demonstrate the importance of various computational skills across the Generic Statistical Business Process model. As we will see, many of the skills are as specific to working with data as they are uncommon to typical IT development teams. However, I argue that there is also a common ground between the worlds of Computing with Data and IT development. This is the field of Software Engineering: the range of techniques and methods aimed at ensuring that software meets quality standards, including maintainability, usability, performance, and so on. I argue that Statistical Offices have a natural need for the role of ‘Research Software Engineer’ (RSE): a person who develops software, based on an understanding of the research goals. An RSE combines an understanding of data processing goals, methods, and technologies while being competent in software engineering, thereby filling the gap between the typical competence areas of statistical analysts and IT developers. DevOps for the statistical production process? (Alexander Kowarik) To modernize the statistical production within an organization producing official statistics, lessons can be learned from so-called DevOps practices in system development. There are several principles that could be easily translated from a traditional software development project, for example “Automate Everything”. Other principles could be adapted, for example “Testing” which could be adapted to include necessary steps for official statistics production such as “Observing Quality Dimensions”. Being completely reproducible is an important goal for official statistics, but this does not only imply requirements on code versioning, but also on data management so it can be accessed in a versioned manner. An implementation at Statistics Austria of a continuous integration / continuous development (CI/CD) pipeline based on R is presented. on implementation at Statistics. Redesign of a statistical production process according to modern architecture principles (Mauro Bruno) The rise of Big Data and, more in general, of new data sources (social media, satellite images, sensor data, etc.) is rapidly changing official statistics’ context. National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) are obliged to change the way they perform their core business, i.e., the production of relevant, timely and high-quality statistical outputs. In traditional surveys, domain experts, researchers and IT experts work on tools and methods tailored to the specific statistical domain, therefore it is very difficult, if not impossible, to share code and methods. In order to remain relevant and attractive to young researchers NSIs should perform a ‘mind shift ’both at organizational and technological level. Domain experts, researchers and IT experts should start working closely on methods shared at NSIs or, even better, at international level. Further they should align to modern architecture principles that foster cross-domain interaction, e.g., github for code versioning, microservices to access algorithms through api, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools to automate code release on production environment, cloud architecture for installation and deployment. Within this context, a few years ago, Istat launched a set of “Experimental Statistics”, aiming at experimenting the use of new sources and the application of innovative methods in producing data. In this paper we focus on “Cosmopolitics” a new experimental statistic designed and implemented according to the architecture principles highlighted above. The statistical production process heavily relies on (statistical) computing throughout all process steps. Historically, ‘official’ software tools were developed and maintained by development units within IT departments, while much processing was automated ‘under the radar’ by users using for example the programmability of office tools and batch scripts.

                 Prof. Curtis Huttenhower ","The human microbiome plays a critical role in human health and disease. Modern technology enables the cost-effective acquisition of high-throughput microbiome data. More recently, longitudinal measurements are often obtained in microbiome studies, allowing us to gain mechanistic insights into microbial dynamics and systems. However, microbiome data have unique features such as compositionality, zero inflation, high skewness, and hierarchical structure, which pose significant challenges to the statistical analysis. In addition, the longitudinality (repeated measurements with a temporal order) makes the analysis even more challenging. Despite the burgeoning resources on longitudinal microbiome studies (e.g., iHMP), statistical methods for such longitudinal, high-dimensional data are still in their infancy. There is a pressing need for more rigorous methodologies that can better harness the power of rich data. The proposed session consists of a group of top-notch international researchers who are actively working on longitudinal microbiome data analysis. The talks will discuss important challenges in this area and propose novel methods for cluster analysis, association analysis, and identifiability assessment for longitudinal microbiome data. The session will have a broad impact on both methodology and application areas. With the new methods, we may better understand the microbial dynamic and its health implications, which promise to revolutionize diagnosis and prognosis and lead to therapeutic breakthroughs. The session will raise strong awareness in the audience and stimulate research interest in this new research area. Talk1: Statistical challenges in longitudinal microbiome data analysis.
The microbiome is a complex and dynamic community of microorganisms that co-exist interdependently within an ecosystem, and interact with its host or environment. Longitudinal studies can capture temporal variation within the microbiome to gain mechanistic insights into microbial systems, however current statistical methods are limited due to the complex and inherent features of the data. We have identified three analytical objectives in longitudinal microbial studies: (1) differential abundance over time and between sample groups, demographic factors or clinical variables of interest; (2) clustering of microorganisms evolving concomitantly across time; and (3) network modelling to identify temporal relationships between microorganisms. We have explored the strengths and limitations of current methods to fulfill these objectives, and compared different methods in simulation and case studies for objectives (1) and (2). We will also present our current methodological developments for objectives (2) and (3).
Talk2: Addressing model identifiability in the analysis of longitudinal sequence count data
A common statistical problem is inference from positive-valued multivariate measurements where the scale (e.g., sum) of the measurements are not representative of the scale (e.g., total size) of the system being studied. This situation is common in the analysis of modern sequencing data. The field of Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) axiomatically states that analyses must be invariant to scale. Yet, many scientific questions posed in the analysis of longitudinal studies rely on the unmeasured system scale for identifiability. Instead, many existing tools make a wide variety of assumptions to identify models, often imputing the unmeasured scale. Here, we analyze the theoretical limits on inference given these data and formalize the assumptions required to provide principled scale reliant inference. Using statistical concepts such as consistency and calibration, we show that we can provide guidance on how to make scale reliant inference from these data. We prove that the Frequentist ideal is often unachievable and that existing methods can demonstrate bias and a breakdown of Type-I error control. We introduce scale simulation estimators and scale sensitivity analysis as a rigorous, flexible, and computationally efficient means of performing scale reliant inference.
Talk3: Dynamic clustering and heterogeneity pursuit with longitudinal microbiome data
 Detecting sample clusters and identifying sources of heterogeneity (i.e., the distinctive microbial components or phenotypic features that differentiate the clusters) play a critical role in unraveling the relationship between microbial profiles and heterogeneous health states. We develop Dirichlet-Multinomial (DM) mixture models with heterogeneity pursuit to cluster microbiome profiles and pinpoint key taxa with distinctive abundances across clusters. We further adapt the heterogeneity pursuit method to the longitudinal setting through a hidden Markov setup to simultaneously identify latent microbial states and characterize the dynamics of state transitions. An application with iHMP data demonstrates the promise of the proposed framework for deciphering the heterogeneity and dynamics of microbiome.

                 Mr Gerry O'Hanlon ; Dr Andreas Georgiou ","Some would argue that principles and ethics for official statistics are to be understood as universal, applying anywhere in the world—any country, any political system, and any cultural environment. Yet, some others would argue that these principles would need to be adapted to national circumstances, to fit the national political and cultural environment, which might be enshrined in national laws and institutions or in often very powerful unwritten traditions and modi operandi.  For example, the statistical principles of independence, impartiality and objectivity might be seen by some as requiring limits and modifications, if the results of statistical production conflict with the prerogatives and priorities of a leader or ruling group in autocracies or of higher ups in sociopolitical systems operating predominantly on the basis of client relations or traditional clan relations. Otherwise, the argument goes, statistical production would be seen as undermining if not entirely upending the political and social order of the country and of its people. It would be equivalent to using the production of official statistics on the basis of such principles as a ram against the existing system and favoring alternative—for example western-style liberal political—systems, in effect supporting ‘neocolonialism’. Some might argue more mildly that without limits and modifications, statistical principles would be presumptuous and not inclusive and accepting enough of alternative cultural systems and values. They would usually see existing major codifications of statistical principles and ethics (and their interpretation by official statisticians in European and North American countries) as Eurocentric or Western culture-centric. Arguments for the need for ‘interpretation’ of official statistical principles and ethics through a national/political/cultural filter do not always refer to the needs of sociopolitical systems outside the grouping of so-called Western liberal democracies and advanced economies. These arguments for national specificities and interpretations can and do arise within the grouping of advanced Western countries/advanced economies itself. Some would argue that political elites that alternate in power in such countries may need to retain some degree of control of official statistics to serve their political interests when in power. Others might argue that the appropriate understanding of national interest in the governance of official statistics is something to be decided on—whatever the outcome of that decision might be—by the democratically elected representatives of the people. The will of the latter, through their elected representatives, should be respected in interpreting many things of importance to the democratic system in place, including statistical principles and ethics. The IPS will aim to explore the above matters. It will address whether statistical principles and ethics as conceptual entities should be adjusted to national/political/cultural circumstances. The discussion will delve into the reasons for arguing for a set (or version) of official statistics principles and ethics instead of another. In this context, the discussion may address the nature of these principles and ethics and their ‘production’ or ‘discovery’. Connections with historical, sociological, philosophical and scientific perspectives could potentially be explored. The IPS will also discuss whether codifications/formulations of principles and ethics available internationally are already subject to such limits and modifications catering to political/political/cultural constraints. The IPS will finally aim to discuss recommendations for future action on thinking about, on formulating/codifying, and on applying principles and ethics for official statistics around the world.

A discussant will bridge the recent papers to the larger body of literature and provide perspective amongst wider challenges for environmental problems. With the evolving climate due to the continuing emission of greenhouse gasses and effects from various policy decisions, changes within observed environmental data are inevitable. Methods for detecting changepoints, which are abrupt shifts in the underlying distribution of a statistical process, continue to be key analysis tools. Changepoint detection is crucial across a wide variety of environmental inferences, from millenium-scale data in ice cores to sub-daily fluctuations in air pollution.  These different scales and data structures motivate novel changepoint detection methods.  This session highlights some recent advances in changepoint detection and their uses in a variety of environmental areas.

It includes four confirmed speakers and one chair, covering different career stages, gender, and countries (2 assistant, 1 associate and 2 full professors, 2 countries): (i) Dr. Sameer Deshpande, Assistant Professor in Statistics, University of Wisconsin–Madison, USA; Talk title: “The multivariate spike-and-slab LASSO: Algorithms, asymptotics, and inference” (ii) Dr. Gang Han, Associate Professor in Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Texas A&M University, USA; Talk title: “Bayesian-frequentist Hybrid Inference in Applications with Small Sample Sizes” (iii) Dr. Johan Lim, Professor in Statistics, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea; Talk title: “Variable Selection in Bayesian Multiple Instance Regression using Shotgun Stochastic Search” (iv) Dr. Sherry Wang, Professor in Statistics and Data Science, Southern Methodist University, USA; Talk title: “Bayesian Empirical Likelihood with Dual Penalties for Ultra-high Dimensional Data”.   The chair will be Dr. Yusen Xia in Business and Data Science from Institute for Insights, Georgia State University, USA. We thank the SPC for taking time to review our proposal and wish you a very successful and productive ISI2023!   1.The multivariate spike-and-slab LASSO: Algorithms, asymptotics, and inference We consider multivariate linear regression models to predict q correlated responses (of possibly mixed type) using a common set of p predictors. Our interest lies not only in determining whether a particular predictor has a direct or marginal effect on each response but also in understanding the residual dependence between the outcomes. We propose a Bayesian procedure for such determination using continuous spike-and-slab priors. Rather than relying on a stochastic search through the high-dimensional parameter space, we develop an Expectation Conditional Maximization algorithm targeting modal estimates of the matrix of regression coefficients and residual precision matrix. A key feature of our method is the model of our uncertainty about which parameters are negligible. We further derive posterior contraction rates and discuss several strategies for quantifying posterior uncertainty.   2.Bayesian-frequentist Hybrid Inference in Applications with Small Sample Sizes The Bayesian-frequentist hybrid model and associated inference can combine the advantages of both Bayesian and frequentist methods and avoid their limitations. However, except for few special cases in existing literature, the computation under the hybrid model is generally non-trivial or even unsolvable. We develop a computation algorithm for hybrid inference under any general loss functions. Simulation and data examples demonstrate that hybrid inference can improve upon frequentist inference by incorporating valuable prior information, and also improve Bayesian inference based on non-informative priors where the latter leads to biased estimates for the small sample sizes used in inference.    3.Variable Selection in Bayesian Multiple Instance Regression using Shotgun Stochastic Search In multiple instance learning (MIL), each sample has a set of covariate vectors (instances) individually observed, but has only one response variable shared by the instances. We propose a Bayesian modeling to address two selection problems. One is the instance selection which finds out the instances with capability of explaining the response. The other is the variable selection which searches for the covariates related with the response. For this, we adopt the stochastic search variable selection (George and McCulloch (1993)) to identify the best subset of explanatory variables, which has not drawn attention in MIL literature before. Our novel model simultaneously solves the two selection tasks by modifying the shotgun stochastic search algorithm (Hans et al. (2007)), which enables Monte Carlo Markov Chain to explore extensive discrete space more efficiently.    4.Bayesian Empirical Likelihood with Dual Penalties for Variable Selection in Ultra-high Dimensional Data In the semi-parametric domain, under the ultra-high dimensional setting, we propose a Bayesian empirical likelihood method for variable selection, which requires no distributional assumptions but only estimating equations. Motivated by Chang et al. (2018) on doubly penalized empirical likelihood (EL), we introduce priors to regularize both regression parameters and Lagrange multipliers associated with the estimating equations, to promote sparse learning. We show theoretically that the posterior consistency and the variable selection consistency are ensured under some mild conditions. We further develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm based on the active set idea, which has been proved to be useful in reducing computational burden.

                 Mr Luis Angel Maza ","The financial value chain is being disrupted and complemented by new, digitized and innovative business models, which are being developed by FinTechs, incumbents and BigTechs. This has an immediate impact on traditional financial services providers, institutions and regulators, and changes the approaches of how to construct, collect and disseminate (statistical) information. Those broad changes call for new approaches of how to construct, collect and disseminate information on FinTechs, while not overburdening start-ups and firms with reporting requirements. In addition, a fast-paced development in specialized technologies, eg from the crypto ecosystem, creates new and innovative forms of business models while also challenging authorities' understanding of those business models. Hence it is important (difficult but ultimately feasible) to gather statistics and other type of information on such Fintech activities and firms. In parallel, and reflecting remarkable development of financial digital technology, various digital assets have mushroomed throughout the world. But, reflecting the novel character of the digital assets, the framework of statistical classification is still undergoing. The objective of this session is to facilitate an active exchange of views and share the experiences of statistics compilers around the world, aiming to develop a framework on new forms of financial activities and digital assets in the SNA. Opinions from users are also indispensable to construct the new framework. Recording digital assets, which include central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), global stablecoins, and other types of crypto-assets, is one of the most important issues in the discussion of BPM6/2008 SNA update, as mentioned in the guidance note (GN) prepared by the Joint Financial and Payment Systems Task Team (FITT). For example, to find an adequate recording rule for crypto-assets without a corresponding liability (eg bitcoins) is a tough challenge.

 18 July 2023,Tuesday,14:00,15:40,IPS 283 - Harnessing data by citizens for public policy and SDG monitoring: a conceptual framework and what is next?,IPS Room 202,Category: IPS,Towards a framework to harness data by citizens: the Istat experience, Prof. Monica Pratesi ,"Citizens’ contribution to data, broadly defined as the engagement of citizens in multiple processes in the data value chain, is increasingly recognized as critical to helping overcome many data challenges of our times. In particular, in the context of the 2030 Agenda’s principle to ensure that nobody is left behind, citizen data helps fill critical data gaps for groups suffering from data marginalization and increase the extent to which their experiences are reflected in national statistics.  In addition to filling data gaps, some citizen data initiatives provide insights into harmful customary practices as well as further advance important values such as fairness, inclusiveness, openness and transparency in statistics. Citizens’ contribution to data could happen at different levels – global, regional, national, or local. The engagement of citizens can be organized by different stakeholders - scientists, community leaders, civil society organisations (CSOs), or individual citizens. Their engagement can contribute to various stages of the data value chain and serve different objectives and contribute to data and policy in many different ways.  The official statistical community also increasingly recognizes the importance of non-state actors in contributing to the inclusiveness of official statistics. For data collection such as censuses and surveys, national statistical offices (NSOs) often partner with CSOs or representatives of marginalized population groups to ensure the inclusiveness of the data and methodology. Unleashing the full potential of citizens for data, however, faces many challenges. These, for example, include the lack of trust between the state and non-state actors, data quality, sustainability and statistical capacity of CSOs, etc. In this context, the United Nations Statistics Division organized an Expert Group Meeting on Harnessing data by citizens for public policy and SDG monitoring: a conceptual framework in November 2022.  The meeting agreed that the development of a framework would be an important next step to help conceptualize the different ways citizens can contribute to data and support the formulation of action points for the community to move forward.  The meeting also agreed to establish a Collaborative as a platform for collaboration and exchange of experiences and to advance the work in this area. The topic was further discussed at the 54th United Nations Statistical Commission in February/March 2023. While the critical role of citizens’ contribution to data was acknowledged, issues of citizen data such as quality, bias, cost and sustainability were all mentioned. The discussion noted that further work needs to be done in this area to conceptualize different types of citizens’ contributions and to develop a normative framework. In this context, the session will: Present the discussions around the “normative” framework as mentioned above to enable harnessing citizens data to inform policy.
Share national experience in engaging citizens in the process of producing and using data

All four presenters are junior, female academics from diverse institutions working in biostatistical application areas. Data integration methods for multi-source data borrow and leverage information from multiple sources for increased statistical efficiency and greater population coverage to yield novel scientific findings. By jointly utilizing data from previously disconnected sources, new scientific hypotheses have been explored that yield a deeper understanding of human biology. Particular challenges that arise in the integration of multi-source data relate to heterogeneity, privacy constraints, and trade-offs between bias and efficiency. The development of methods to address these challenges is key for the long term success of data integration. The primary focus of this session is to present the statistical challenges, opportunities and recent developments in integrative inference with data from multiple sources. Drs. Duan, Gu, Jin and Wang, four outstanding junior women working in this field, will discuss recent cutting-edge methodological contributions in data integration problems. The scheduled talk titles are:

Public Health distinguishes itself from other health sciences and includes Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Health Policy and Community, Environmental, Occupational, Global Health among its many components. Statistical challenges in Public Health are broad, diverse and at the same time unique. The vision of this session is to provide a platform for exposition of current and innovative statistical methodologies in emerging Public Health challenges in areas as diverse as analysis of effects of persistent organic pollutants in environmental mixtures on individual health outcomes such as diabetes incidence to longitudinal trajectories of COVID-19 vaccinations in different localities and its relation to other hyperlocal health and socioeconomic indicators. The methodologies to be presented in this session will emphasize the significant methodological advances made over the current practices in these emerging areas and highlight the increasing relevance of statistics and statisticians in helping solve the problems of the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted a multitude of emerging statistical challenges in Public Health which are unique and distinct from other areas in health sciences with areas such as environmental epidemiology having detailed measurements on persistent organic pollutants that depict ultra-high correlation/inter-dependence whereas other areas only having spatially aggregated data at locality (zip code, census tract) level. Integration of meta-data from multiple levels, such as individual and aggregated, or from multiple entities, brings in a host of methodological challenges. In the spirit of ISI2023 theme  of Statistical Science for a better world,  this session will include four internationally renowned researchers from South Africa and the United States who have committed to present their innovations at the Congress.

It is critical today to optimize efficiency in field activities. Whether you are interested in improving coordination, reducing reliance on paper, eliminating redundancies, or creating efficiencies, GIS can help.   Traditional paper-based methods of census data collection have proven to be tedious, time consuming, costly and often prone to errors. To overcome these problems, Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) methods are increasingly replacing pen-and-paper methods as a viable alternative for field data collection. The technological developments in mobile computing, storage, higher connectivity and network coverage have made the CAPI approach possible for many.  As increasingly powerful hand-held devices are now an affordable and realistic option, the CAPI approach is being more commonly used. Realizing the advantages of direct digital data entry into a computer software application at the point of data collection through the use mobile technology for data collection and statistical production, the United Nations has recommended its use in the 2020 Round of Censuses in recognition of its importance and usefulness for many countries. The ArcGIS system comes with many tools that can be used for data collection. ArcGIS Field Maps is an all-in-one app that uses data-driven maps to help mobile workers perform field data collection and editing, including map editing. ArcGIS Survey123 is a complete form-centric solution for creating smart surveys and forms. ArcGIS QuickCapture allows you to configure a simple UI to capture data even from a moving vehicle. In this session, you will hear about different country experiences using these field mobile applications to streamline workflows and ensure data accuracy.   Organiser: Mrs Linda Peters  Chair: Mrs Linda Peters  Speaker: Kate Hess  Speaker: Joseph Kerski",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/358/details/

The Action Framework of the Implementation of the New Urban Agenda and the Global Strategy to improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics both highlight the need for a harmonized method to facilitate international comparisons and to improve the quality of rural and urban statistics in support of development policies and investment decisions. In recent years, six international organizations, the European Union, The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Labour Office (ILO), the OECD, UN-Habitat and the World Bank have joined forces and developed a new method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas in a harmonized way. In 2020, the UN Statistical Commission endorsed this new method, called the Degree of Urbanisation. This new method based on a population grid allows for a harmonized comparison of urbanisation across the globe and facilitates international statistical comparisons of the performance of rural areas. The session aims at presenting the challenges of implementing the definition at national and international level, as well as demonstrating the opportunities it offers in measuring Sustainable Development Goals. The session will also highlight potential extensions of the method to capture at higher granularity the urban-rural continuum.

                 PROF. DR. Junji Nakano ","In the regime of big data, citation information is gathered from large-scale database and represented in a network form. A citation network analysis is a quantitative method to identify important and impacted literature of afield based on how often a publication is cited in other publications. This analysis has recently become an essential tool to evaluate scientific achievements in different entities, including research articles, individual researchers, scientific journals, international conference, research institutes, and many others. This invited session gathers scientometric scholars to showcase their statistical methods and metrics to analyze this scientific network, and share their findings and insights from their analytical results. The topics include the network generative mechanism, underlying model assumption, statistical metrics, and data visualization.  In specific, Professor Junji Nakano will talk about ""A Stochastic Generative Model for Citation Networks among Academic Papers"". This work proposes a stochastic generative model to represent a directed graph constructed by citations among academic papers. It approximates the importance of a cited paper by its in-degrees. By using the Web of Science database to see the features in the model, it generates simulated graphs and demonstrates the similarity to the original data. Professor Hohyun Jung will talk about ""Weighted Evolving Hypergraph Model with Preferential Attachment"". This work proposed a weighted evolving hypergraph model that considers preferential attachments. The model allows variability on the number and size of the hypergraphs to be connected. The degree distribution of the model can be expressed as a mixture of the degree distribution with a fixed number of hyperedges to be connected. This model is implemented in the analysis of the Web of Science. Professor Thorsten Koch will talk about ""Article's Scientific Prestige: Measuring the Impact of Individual Articles in the Web of Science"". It performed a citation analysis on the Web of Science publications consisting of more than 63 million articles and 1.45 billion citations on 254 subjects from 1981 to 2020, and proposes the Article's Scientific Prestige (ASP) metric for measuring the scientific impact of individual articles in the large-scale hierarchical and multi-disciplined citation network. ASP tends to provide more persuasive rankings than existing metrics when the articles are not highly cited. The journal grade is unable to properly reflect the scientific impact of individual articles. Professor Frederick Kin Hing Phoa will talk about ""A New Planetarium Mode to Visualize Ego-Centric Networks and its Applications to Large-Scale Scientific Citation and Collaboration Networks"". It introduces an efficient three-step approach to optimally allocate alter nodes uniformly on the surface of a con-centric sphere, with the consideration of the existing edges among alter nodes and without overlapping of node clusters. It is applied to the data visualization of author collaboration networks . Further, an additional patch is introduced to handle networks with directed edges between the ego node and its alter nodes, and it is applied to the data visualization of scientific citation networks.

                 Robert Gramacy ","Complex numerical models are ubiquitous in physical, atmospheric, biological, and engineering sciences. These models, often called simulators, are used to describe complicated interactions among many variables and processes in the systems and are usually accompanied by massive data. These simulators, acting as the forward model, are often required in forward propagation of uncertainty in simulation-based experiments and sensitivity analysis. In addition, we often need to extract information about parameters or unknown processes based on the simulators and data, called inverse problems. Surrogate models are often needed to reduce computational cost of forward model simulation and inverse problems. However, many surrogate modeling methods rely on the assumption of a particular parametric functional form or the assumption of Gaussian distribution, and often don’t scale well with the dimensionality or adapt to the geometry of input and output spaces. Presentations in this invited session will highlight some latest statistical methodological developments to address these challenges on surrogate modeling in uncertainty quantification and novel applications of surrogate models in forward simulation, calibration and inverse problems in biosciences, remote sensing, engineering, and climate sciences.    Session Makeup: 4 speakers (listed alphabetically)  Robert Gramacy, Professor, Department of Statistics, Virginia Tech, rbg@vt.edu  Jon Hobbs, Data Scientist, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Caltech, jhobbs@jpl.nasa.gov  Emily L.

Organizer: African Centre for Statistics, UNECA Contact person: Ms. Angela Kiconco angela.kiconco@un.org,   Ms. Gloria Mathenge gloria.mathenge@un.org The African statistical community has globally recognized that producers of official statistics need to transform and modernize themselves to adequately respond to all data demands arising from SDG, Agenda 2063, national development plans and other agendas and frameworks. This transformation and modernization cover all areas of official statistics, including the institutional statistical environment, production processes, coordination and collaboration. This session proposal covers major developments in Africa in terms of modernizing the statistical systems on the continent specifically on Data revolution, the use of administrative and CRVS data, change through the Statistical Leadership and GIS.   1. Will Africa be the next epicenter of the data revolution?  Just like mobile telephony had an astounding boom in Africa because the wired telecommunication infrastructures were very inadequate, we are expecting innovative data science methods based on new data sources to flourish on the continent due to the weak state of the statistical systems and the resulting wide gap between the demand and the offer of data for evidence-based decision-making. We are expecting Africa to be the one of the epicenters of the data revolution in the coming years. From the use of satellite imagery to monitor the degradation of natural capital stock and measure land use and land cover to the use of mobile tracking data to improve knowledge of migrations, cross-border formal and informal trade, and the development of digital id solutions to tackle the scandal of invisibility that makes people be born, live and die without their government being aware of their existence, the opportunities for applying innovative data science techniques to solve practical problems on the African continent are immense. ECA is therefore advocating for the African statistical community to tap into this huge potential by giving training in data science and initiating innovative data science projects through among others, the UN Regional Data Hub on big data and data science and the African Research Centre on Artificial Intelligence that was established in Brazzaville, Congo.   2. Transforming and modernizing of Africa Statistical System: Change through the Statistical Leadership Programme  In the context of causing change using the top to bottom approach, the statistical leadership programme delivered by the UK’s Office for National Statistics, in collaboration with the African Centre for Statistics (ACS) and the African Institute for Economic Development and Planning (IDEP) at the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) targets to strengthen Africa Statistical systems by addressing issues of self-awareness and confidence, leading teams and individuals, improving influencing skills, leading and change management as well as building networks. This paper presents findings on how the statistical leadership programme has the impacted the leaders in National Statistical Offices in relation to contributing to transforming and modernizing the Africa Statistical System.  3. Building effective and integrated CRVS Systems in Africa in the context of transforming and modernizing National Statistical Systems   Civil registration systems are considered by the United Nations to be the most reliable sources of vital statistics . Civil registration systems are also the basis for establishment of population registers which also provide a potentially excellent source of data for generating vital statistics and key demographic indicators. A functional population register can only exist where there is a well-functioning civil registration system. Despite their recognized importance, civil registration systems have been performing dismally in most part of Africa over the past 50 years. This paper will review progress in the development of civil registration and population register systems on the continent and to advocate for the increased use of these data sources for derivation of demographic data and statistics.   4. Geospatial Technologies for modernizing and transforming National Statistical Systems in Africa   The availability of consistent and accurate geographic information is a key enabler for the growth of national economies. Geospatial information technologies are essential for designing economic and social elements of services of governments such as transportation, energy, the environment, health care, and education. Mapping Socio-economic indicators improves the ability to make a better decision in the various socio-economic development sectors. Collecting, managing, and analysing administrative data also rely heavily on Geospatial Information Technologies. Geospatial technology has modified the way in which data from national statistics offices are collected, stored, produced, and disseminated. Many countries have started to integrate GIS into their census mapping processes and surveys, developed a geo-referenced database of dwelling locations and clearly delineated enumeration area boundaries from high-resolution satellite imagery. Transformation and modernization of statistical systems in Africa are following the path to integrate the geospatial information with statistics which is now recognized globally and in the continent.  Organiser:Mr Kossi Edem Kludza  Chair:Mr Oliver J.

Title: “What happened with income inequality in Europe during 2020-2022?”. Promoting income equality is one of the main social economic targets for enhancing the equal opportunities of people’s wellbeing. Global challenges started in 2020 (COVID-19, war in Ukraine, spike of energy prices and increased inflation) affected all countries. During COVID-19, the impact of multiple lockdowns was spread in the reduction of the jobs or stand stills of the enterprises. The governments provided, to varying degrees, replacement wages or compensations to enterprises. However the least socially protected population (as economically inactive or with undeclared jobs)  might not have fully benefited from the government funding thus bearing the impact of COVID-19 to a large extent. Technical difficulties have also arisen in household surveys to correctly measure the different impacts and ad hoc solutions had to be implemented. In addition, in 2022 the war in Ukraine and spike of energy prices and inflation, might have affected the different population groups in various extent.
The aim of this session is to explore the impact of the global challenges on the distribution of income across countries with an eye also on measurement issues in household surveys.

Moreover, observations in this kind of data can be missing or subject to some upper and/or lower detection limits because of the restriction of the experimental apparatus. For such data structures, we propose a novel robust regression model for multiply censored or missing data based on the multivariate skew-t distribution. This approach allows us to model data with great flexibility, simultaneously accommodating heavy tails and skewness. We develop an analytically simple, yet efficient, EM-type algorithm to conduct maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters. The algorithm has closed-form expressions at the E-step that rely on formulas for the mean and variance of truncated multivariate Student's-t, skew-t, and extended skew-t distributions. Furthermore, a general information-based method for approximating the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimators is also presented. Results obtained from the analysis of both simulated and real datasets are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The 2nd presenter: Professor Wan-Lun Wang Title: A selection approach to multivariate linear mixed models with censored and non-ignorable missing responses Abstract: The analysis of multivariate longitudinal data could encounter some complications due to censorship induced by detection limits of the assay and non-response occurring when participants missed scheduled visits intermittently or discontinued participation. This paper establishes a generalization of the multivariate linear mixed model that can accommodate censored responses and non-ignorable missing outcomes simultaneously. To account for the non-ignorable missingness, the selection approach which decomposes the joint distribution as a marginal distribution for the primary outcome variables and a model describing the missing process conditional on the hypothetical complete data is used. A computationally feasible Monte Carlo expectation conditional maximization (MCECM) algorithm is developed for parameter estimation with the maximum likelihood (ML) method. Furthermore, a general information-based approach is presented to assess the variability of ML estimators. The techniques for the prediction of censored responses and imputation of missing outcomes are also discussed. The methodology is motivated and exemplified by a real dataset concerning HIV-AIDS clinical trials. A simulation study is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed method compared with other traditional approaches. The 3rd presenter: Professor Luis Mauricio Castro Title: Using joint random partition models for flexible change point analysis in multivariate processes Abstract: Change point analyses are concerned with identifying positions of an ordered stochastic process that undergo abrupt local changes of some underlying distribution. When multiple processes are observed, it is often the case that information regarding the change point positions is shared across the different processes. This work describes a method that takes advantage of this type of information. Since the number and position of change points can be described through a partition with contiguous clusters, our approach develops a joint model for these types of partitions. We describe computational strategies associated with our approach and illustrate improved performance in detecting change points through a small simulation study. We then apply our method to a financial data set of emerging markets in Latin America and highlight interesting insights discovered due to the correlation between change point locations among these economies. The 4th presenter: Professor Tsung-I Lin Title: Flexible clustering for asymmetric data via mixtures of unrestricted skew normal factor analyzers Abstract: Mixtures of factor analyzers (MFA) based on the restricted skew normal distribution (rMSN) has been shown to be a flexible tool to handle asymmetrical high-dimensional data with heterogeneity. However, the rMSN distribution is oft-criticized a lack of sufficient ability to accommodate potential skewness arisen from more than one feature space. This paper presents an alternative extension of MFA by assuming the unrestricted skew normal (uMSN) distribution for the component factors. In particular, the proposed mixtures of unrestricted skew normal factor analyzers (MuSNFA) can simultaneously capture multiple directions of skewness and deal with the occurrence of missing values or nonresponses. Under the missing at random (MAR) mechanism, we develop a computationally feasible expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters. Practical aspects related to model-based clustering, prediction of factor scores and missing values are also discussed. The utility of the proposed methodology is illustrated with the analysis of simulated data and the Pima Indian women diabetes data containing genuine missing values.

Recent years have seen the growth of fact checking bodies, but this session aims to explore what more can be done to support good decision making. The session will include a tribute to Tim Holt, and then 5 min opening statements followed by a panel discussion. Among the questions to be considered are: How should the role of national statistics offices change to meet these challenges? Where is there good practice? To what extent does the move towards model-based estimates undermine confidence in statistics? How can we improve the statistical literacy of governments, businesses and citizens? Is there any role for greater regulation?

Internally displaced women and children are more at risk of assess due to some prevailing factors increasing the plight of women and children.Reports from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) show that Nigeria has the worst humanitarian crisis in Africa occasioned by insurgency related to violent onslaught led by Boko Haram, ISWAP, Fulani Herdsmen and other unclassified bandits. Available data show that Nigeria is a country where the population of those presently under the age of 15 years make up almost half of the entire 200 million people (about 46 percent). The current total for children under the age of 5 stands at nearly 31 million with at least 7 million babies born each year. Also, a little over one in three of Nigeria’s whole population lives below the poverty line, among children this proportion surges to 75 percent.More than 2 million of the Nigeria population have been uprooted from their homes due to violent insurgency with over 10 percent reported missing, out of which more than 70 percent are women and children. Women and children in IDP camps are exposed to sexual exploitation, rape, molestation, restricted movement, poor sanitation, hunger, diseases, etc. This study explores the application of risk management as a strategy to help advance the safety of vulnerable women and children in high risk areas and regions.Risk management is the methodical application of management processes, practices, and actions to the task of assessing, analyzing, evaluation, and control of risk in an activity.It involves the identification, analysis, assessment,and control by using any or combination of the strategy of avoidance, minimization, elimination or transfer of the risks.The risk management approach will involve qualitative methods for data collection through interviews, scooping review of journals and other serials, and visiting affected communities, regions, refugee shelters and IDP camps.Risk management has been established to give competitive advantage in military operations in counter-insurgency, and therefore, will be mobilized in this study as innovative procedure in safeguarding the wellbeing of women and children against violent security challenges. Three themes for presentation will be deduced from the innovative implementation of risk management in safeguarding women and children from violent insurgency in developing countries. The first theme will focus on identifying the risk factors associated with the plight of women and children in compromised and vulnerable zones and regions and establishing risk assessment strategies. The second theme will be aimed at establishing the vulnerable areas, IDP camps, refugee shelters and procure relevant records on women and children. The third theme will be the implementation of the risk management procedure, establishing key advantages, highlighting possible challenges and mediating factors. Profiles of Presenters Polycarp E. Chigbu Polycarp Chigbu is a Regent Professor of Statistics in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria. He has served as the Director, Academic Planning, Dean, School of Postgraduate Studies, and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) in the University.He has chaired different committees and presented public lectures on risk assessment and strategic elimination of external and internal threats to the university education system towards a safer society.He is author of over 80 technical papers. Prof. Chigbu will present research report on the theme pertaining to identifying the risk factors associated with the plight of women and children in the compromised and vulnerable areas and regions and establishing risk assessment strategies.

We will present the opportunities and challenges of utilizing satellite imagery that has been carried out by various researchers and communities in producing SDGs indicators to support official statistics. We will highlight which SDGs indicators in environmental aspects can be monitored using satellite imagery. In the future, the research that has been done can be implemented into a business process model for official statistics. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set targets by 2030 for a just future for planet earth. These targets consist of 17 goals, 169 targets, and 232 indicators that are used as a reference by member countries. Measurement of each indicator requires accurate and up-to-date data to be reported as well as a benchmark for progress. The ease of obtaining data, high temporal frequency, low cost, and wide coverage make remote sensing a solution to support official statistics sourced from conventional data. Satellite imagery data is a potential alternative solution to support various SDGs indicators by mapping, monitoring, and evaluating earth phenomena. This study present the opportunities and challenges of utilizing satellite imagery that has been carried out by various researchers and communities in producing SDGs indicators to support official statistics.

                 Dr Rochelle Garner ","This session will highlight recent and ongoing work in disease modelling at Statistics Canada. Building on a strong foundation of collecting high-quality population health data, Statistics Canada has developed cancer and chronic disease projection models to aid prevention efforts and policy making. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the appetite to use disease modelling to aid in decision making grew considerably. Disease modelling and modellers were suddenly thrust into the limelight! The pandemic has highlighted that population health modelling, which considers the interplay between sociodemographic factors, risk factors and health/disease states in complex open populations, is perhaps more relevant now than at any other time in history. National Statistical Agencies can play several different roles in developing population health models, including data collection, methodology development, and fostering collaboration with policy departments and external academics. Increasingly, these multidisciplinary and multi-institute teams work within a modern “data-science” and Open Science framework to support complex modelling projects. Presenting this work at the ISI World Statistics Congress will allow Statistics Canada researchers to gain a diverse and rich perspective on their work from the international statistics community. The format of the session will include three speakers and one discussant. 1. Epidemiological modelling of COVID-19 to inform PPE demand and supply in Canada 
The global SARS-CoV2 pandemic initiated a surge in demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) in Canada. PPE continues to have a prominent role in combating the transmission of infection, especially in health and personal care settings. As such, the Government of Canada urgently needed to provide timely, accurate and relevant information on PPE procurement and deployment to provinces and territories, in the face of global supply shortages. In response, Health Canada partnered with Statistics Canada to create the Pan-Canadian Demand and Supply Model. This session will describe the collaboration between the two organizations, including how the model was used to support decision-making and how modern data-driven methods were brought to bear on this difficult question. 2. Using Statistics Canada data to measure the population burden of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and mortality 
Statistics Canada administers a suite of national population health surveys that span more than 20 years and include 1.5 million respondents. The core health survey (Canadian Community Health Survey) covers a range of sociodemographic, behavioural, health and health care questions. Common questions are replicated in smaller surveys that include biophysical measurements or periodic special topics such as detailed food and nutrition. Disease development, transition to different care settings, and death for over 10 million person-years of follow-up are examined through linkage to an increasing range of health administrative data, disease registries, and vital statistics. During the pandemic, these health surveys included additional questions regarding Covid-19, and these can also be linked to administrative data for Covid-19 testing, vaccination and health outcomes. 
Combining large samples and longitudinal follow-up provides the foundation for observational studies that assess health risks. Cross-sectional population health surveys provide the starting population for models, and these are used to assess and recalibrate models. Predictive studies (algorithms) developed using health surveys are used in the clinical (individual) and population setting. In the population setting, risk algorithms are used for various modelling approaches, including closed cohort, stationary, and microsimulation models. 3. Microsimulation modelling of chronic disease and cancer to inform prevention and policy 
Statistics Canada has a long history of developing microsimulation models on various topics, including population health. The Population Health Model (POHEM) was developed to project the presence and impact of health-related risk factors on the burden of certain chronic conditions and mortality in the Canadian population. Additionally, OncoSim was developed in collaboration with the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer to model four cancer sites (breast, colorectal, lung, and cervical) and related screening programs in detail, and to provide high-level projections for 25 cancer sites for use by decision-makers to better understand the impact of cancer control interventions.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, POHEM and OncoSim were used to evaluate consequences of pandemic-related lockdowns/restrictions, including changes in health behaviours and paused cancer screening programs. This session will describe how these models were used to evaluate pandemic-related impacts, and how they can be used in a post-pandemic reality to evaluate longer-term health outcomes for the Canadian population.

                 Mr Marco Marini ","The goal of this panel session is to discuss requirements for a governance structure around responsible design, development and deployment of Machine Learning (ML) solutions in National Statistical Offices.   With the wide-scale utilization and adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), core principles such as ethics, privacy, equity, procedural fairness, trust, accountability, transparency, explainability, interpretability, reproducibility, robustness, quality and legality are far more important today than ever before. As a result, contextualization or the mapping exercise from model properties to system properties will be necessary as more and more complex Machine Learning or ML-based solutions are used in National Statistical Offices (NSOs) for various purposes, ranging from collection, integration, processing and dissemination.
Moreover, issues related to Responsible ML are complex and broad and encompass not only technical issues but also societal, legal, and ethical ones. One of the key components of Responsible ML systems is explainability, but other issues such as fairness, bias detection and the ability to objectively audit AI systems are also critical for successful applications and adoption of AI in NSOs. The session will consist of 3-4 invited speakers with the aim to discuss these topics, among others, e.g. uncertainty, robustness, … as they pertain to the Official Statistics. The session will be divided in two parts, with a series of brief presentations by the speakers followed by a panel discussion between the speakers, moderated by the chair.   Organiser:Dr Saeid Molladavoudi  Chair:Dr Saeid Molladavoudi  Speaker:Dr Barteld Braaksma  Speaker:Ms Claire Clark Speaker: Andrea del Monaco Speaker: Marco Marini  ",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/375/details/

                 Prof. Ying Jin ","This session explores the use of non-traditional data sources and advanced data science inspired methods to maximise positive outcomes on the environment, public health and the economy. The increasing amount of data collected on the environment, human mobility, health and how we conduct our daily lives as a society has the potential to dramatically inspire and transform policy design and implementation, particularly in the field of air quality monitoring and its impact on health on the general population. With relatively easy access to utilising near real-time data, including satellite imagery, low-cost air quality monitoring sensors, traffic cameras, human mobility data, we have a tremendous opportunity to predict quantified impacts of proposed policy interventions and thus determine interventions with the greatest outcomes on public health, the environment and the economy. This session will bring together some of the leading experts across the public sector and academic organisations in the UK to share the latest developments and case studies covering a range of policy critical issues on this topic. The session will be of interest to a broad range of audience, including statisticians, data scientists, policy makers and academics.   Air pollution is a destructive global crisis and it remains one of the biggest and most immediate environmental threats to human health, causing significant premature deaths and adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular and respiratory disease, cancer, neurological effects, and birth outcomes. Human mobility is expected to play a key role in influencing the air quality which in turn is expected to have an impact on the health of the general population. In this session, we aim to bring together case studies from the UK public sector organisations and beyond who have taken innovative approaches to explore and better understand the climate change—human mobility—health nexus. The session will be a series of talks involving non-traditional big data sources and advanced machine learning modelling techniques to understand the complex interplay between climate change, health and mobility and showcase tools to aid policy makers through evidence-based decision making. The session will be of interest to a broad range of audience as the case studies will tackle some of the major technical and methodological hurdles requiring a consolidation of the advanced statistical and machine learning techniques. Causal inferences can be a real challenge in a data landscape with highly interrelated influences such as mobility, health and air pollution. The session will present ways to tackle this challenge with real world examples.  Uncovering the complex interplay amongst the three chosen influences will be the common theme of the session and since these influences have both spatial and temporal dimensions, the sessions will present methods and analysis developed to unify the spatial-temporal dimensions of the chosen influences. The session will also include recent research on the Health outcomes on the general population after controlling for a range of socio-economic, demographic indicators, mobility patterns and land use patterns to develop a comprehensive understanding of the societal and health impacts of air pollution. Session will also contribute towards developing our understanding into human mobility and urban planning using state of the art machine learning methods.  This session will be of interest to the policy makers to make informed decisions as the society makes a transition into the post COVID world. The techniques and analysis presented in this session have a potential to be useful to other National Statistical Institutes and academic community and we believe the session can be a useful addition to the scientific programme of the conference particularly in relation to the well-being and welfare of the people.   Organiser:Chaitanya Joshi  Chair:Myer Glickman Speaker:Myer Glickman  Speaker:Chaitanya Joshi  Speaker:Ying Jin ",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/371/details/

                 Ms Gail Burrill ","Several recent documents have focused on looking at emerging trends and identifying challenges in the teaching and learning of statistics at all levels. The session will engage participants in considering two of these documents: the American Statistical Association’s Pre-K–12 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education II: A Framework for Statistics and Data Science Education report (GAISE II) and the paper Reviews on Important Themes in Statistics Education to be published by Springer as a part of a larger series on mathematics education. GAISE I provided a framework of recommendations for developing students’ foundational skills in statistical reasoning in three levels across the school years, described as levels A, B, and C. GAISE II, updated using current statistics education research, builds on the ideas in GAISE I (2007) but incorporates the new skills needed for making sense of data today’s world. GAISE II connects to the ideas laid out in the GAISE College Report (2016), which makes recommendations on what to teach in introductory courses and on how to teach those courses. The report includes an updated list of learning objectives along with suggested topics that might be omitted or de-emphasized in an introductory course. The review paper identifies six themes that seem to capture the recent trends and directions in statistics education research: the emerging role of data science and its connection to statistics education and computational thinking; the changing demands in what it means to be statistically literate; the curriculum gap between what is or has been taught in statistics education, what is needed in practice, and what has been learned from research; new ways to characterize students' reasoning and conceptions; the role and nature of statistical inference; statistical modeling and the role of technology. The paper highlights publications that elaborate on these themes or aspects of these themes. The discussion is of importance to not only those who teach statistics but also to those who prepare those who will teach statistics. The demands of this data driven world make it an imperative that our education systems pivot to meeting the needs of those who live and work in such a world.

                 Prof. Raymond L. Chambers ","The journal Survey Methodology has established in 2001 an annual invited paper series in honor of the late Joseph Waksberg to recognize his outstanding contributions to survey statistics and methodology. Each year a prominent survey statistician is chosen by a four-person selection committee appointed by Survey Methodology and the American Statistical Association. The selected statistician is invited to write a paper for Survey Methodology that reviews the development and current state of an important topic in the field of survey statistics and methodology. The recipient of the Waksberg Award is also invited to give the Waksberg Invited Address. The 2023 winner of the Waksberg Award is Prof. Ray Chambers from the University of Wollongong. He will give his Waksberg Invited Address at the 2023 World Statistics Congress in Ottawa. Sample surveys, as a tool for administration and research, have been employed for over a century. In that time, they have primarily served as tools for collecting data for enumerative purposes, i.e., for describing the observable characteristics of a well-defined finite population. Estimation of these characteristics have been typically based on weighting and repeated sampling, or design-based, inference.

ASMBI sessions are devoted to relevant topics about the use of stochastic models in business and industrial statistics. A talk is usually given by a recognised leader in the field and then two discussants are invited to comment on it. The final result is a paper to be published, along with its discussions, in the jurnal.   The impacts of the environment on human health are significant and can include air, water, and noise pollution, exposure to toxic chemicals, food contamination, and climate change. Despite a growing understanding of environmental health impacts in international research literature, significant obstacles exist in comprehending key characteristics of these impacts. These obstacles include data volumes, data access rights, the time required to compile and compare data over regions and time, and the derivation of credible insights from the complex derived information. Business and industry, including local government representatives, must overcome these obstacles to understand the impact of the natural and built environment on human health and make important decisions regarding health policy, resource allocation, and intervention strategies. In this presentation, we introduce the AusEnHealth platform which aims to address the barriers in environmental health data by providing an open data repository as well as methodology for producing environmental health indicators and health outcome weighted population vulnerability indices at the statistical area level 2 (SA2) geographical resolution across Australia. AusEnHealth’s extensive interdisciplinary data set repository and analysis techniques allow policy makers, health managers, and researchers to identify key population characteristics, environmental exposures, and track overall vulnerability changes in their area over time. This enables more effective strategies for the prevention or mitigation of economic and health burdens associated with the natural and built environment. The presentation will also address the critical challenge of accessing required data for products such as AusEnHealth, This is a particular issue for commercially private or personally sensitive data sources in industry and health. We discuss our efforts to develop federated analysis approaches which allow data to remain with the data custodians and the analysis to be performed in the cloud. This requires novel modifications to the models and algorithms underpinning the analyses.

                 Dr piero falorsi","Longitudinal studies, based on repeated observations of the same statistical units over time, represent an invaluable source for analysing the current state and the changes in human populations over time. Longitudinal studies traditionally comprehend panel studies, planned according to specific periodicity and time length, cohort studies based on people with shared experience (e.g. master's degree or first maternity) or characteristics at a particular time point (year of birth), retrospective studies based on different sources regarding past times. Victorian Britain used panel opinions to make better decisions in the nineteenth century. In the 1950s, we saw a lot of progress with panel studies, which were used to track client satisfaction with enterprises. Panel studies include a wide range of topics, including health, psychology, sociology, education, income, housing, and work experiences. In the 19th century, Victorian Britain collected panel opinions for better decisions. Also, the relevant price index survey can be considered a panel survey where the observational units are goods and services over time. Relevant examples at the EU and North-American levels are the National panel survey (ONS), the European labour force quarterly survey the American SIPPs survey. We cite even the Living Standard Measurement Study (LSMS) (World Bank, 2021). This survey provides information on health, access to essential services (water, etc.), risk of malnutrition, poverty status, etc., for over 50 developing countries. In this session, we'll look at three important longitudinal studies that have been undertaken around the world. The LSMS survey, the ONS Coronavirus COVID-19 Infection Survey, and the Longitudinal Social Data Development Program in Canada are all taken into consideration. In the Session, we'll go over many facets of this type of research. We shall go deeper into the problem of representativeness for the current time of data gathered through longitudinal observations and the concept of integrating sources for reconstructing longitudinal data. Furthermore, we will investigate some significant topics studied with longitudinal observation, such as the spread of infection and the transition to different conditions related to wellbeing.

PRESENTATIONS 1.Improving the quality of survey estimates from longitudinal studies.  Authors. Paolo Righi (Istat), Giulia Ponzini (World Bank), Piero Falorsi (University La Sapienza, Rome).  Summary. This work focuses on the case of panels with a rotating sample design. This case represents a powerful hybrid solution for facing the sample erosion for deaths and movers and the impact of lack of sample representativeness for new births, migration flows. Moreover, the sample fatigue introduces an increasing measurement error. As the length of the panel surveys increases, there is an increasing interest, but also increasing challenges in preserving the quality of the panel sample estimates. The effect is particularly evident in long-run panels. A correct design, implementation, and use of a panel survey shall consider a set of methods to deal with these problems at different stages of the statistical process: The sampling design, the data collection, and the estimation.  2. Developing a Proxy Labour Force Indicator in the Longitudinal Social Data Development Program (LSDDP).  Authors. Abdelnasser Saïdi. (Chief – Statistical Integration Methods Division, Analytical Studies, Methodology and Statistical Infrastructure Field. Center of expertise in record linkage and Social Statistics administrative Databases.  Summary. A proxy labour force indicator has been developed for the work domain of the Longitudinal Social Data Development Program (LSDDP) using microdata integration. The categories are defined in the same way as for the Labour Force Survey (LFS), namely: Employed (Category A), Unemployed (category B) or Out of Labour Force (category C). The purpose of this work is not to replace or compete with the LFS estimates, but to be able to derive a monthly proxy employment status (A,B,C) for each individual in the LSDDP population universe from the resulting algorithm. The microdata linkage required was performed using anonymized linkage keys and that quality assessments (MSE, classification error) have been conducted and compared to results from the LFS and the Census. It is anticipated that employment statistics could be improved for different subdomains of interest (e.g. age, sex/gender, census geography, economic region) in using small area estimation technique. We will discuss the results and limitations of this work.  3. Looking back at the ONS Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey.  Authors. Katie Davis. (Principal Methodologist, Methodology and Quality Directorate, Office for National Statistics). Summary. The paper highlights several aspects of the ONS Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey, which has a longitudinal structure retesting participants to see how to swab positivity and antibody positivity change over time. The CIS represents a very relevant and almost unique experience for official statistics as it provides regular estimates of relevant parameters (infection rates, antibody positivity) related to the spread of the pandemic. It also allows more ad-hoc analysis into aspects such as a more detailed look into re-infections.  4. Survival Modelling of Panel Attrition: A proposal with Application to Ethiopia’s HFPS Data  Authors. Barbara Guardabascio (University of Perugia), Diego Zardetto (World Bank)  Summary. Nonresponse and attrition are among the most significant problems for panel surveys, as they result in loss of data, decreased estimation efficiency, and increased risk of bias in research findings. Although nonresponse and attrition are sharply distinct phenomena conceptually, separating them rigorously can sometimes prove challenging in practice. To analyze in depth and disentangle these two phenomena, we propose an operational definition of attrition that strives to characterize attritors as units with a persistent non-respondent state over time. We use longitudinal data from the Ethiopia’s High Frequency Phone Survey to model our definition of attrition through survival analysis methods. The ultimate aim of our research would be to exploit the fitted survival model, after careful out-of-sample validation, to predict attrition hazards in similar ongoing panels, and optimize accordingly survey management decisions during data collection. In this session, we'll look at three important longitudinal studies that have been undertaken around the world. The LSMS survey, the ONS Coronavirus COVID-19 Infection Survey, and the Longitudinal Social Data Development Program in Canada are all taken into consideration. In the Session, we'll go over many facets of this type of research. 
The first presentation focuses on the case of panels with a rotating sample design. This case represents a powerful hybrid solution for facing the sample erosion for deaths and movers and the impact of lack of sample representativeness for new births, migration flows. Moreover, the sample fatigue introduces an increasing measurement error. As the length of the panel surveys increases, there is an increasing interest, but also increasing challenges in preserving the quality of the panel sample estimates. The effect is particularly evident in long run panels. A correct design, implementation, and use of a panel survey shall consider a set of methods to deal with these problems at different stages of the statistical process: The sampling design, the data collection, and the estimation.
The second presentation illustrates how a proxy labour force indicator has been developed for the work domain of the Longitudinal Social Data Development Program (LSDDP) using microdata integration.  The purpose of this work is to derive a monthly proxy employment status for each individual in the LSDDP population universe from the resulting algorithm.  The microdata linkage required was performed using anonymized linkage keys and that quality assessments have been conducted and compared to results from the LFS and the Census.  It is anticipated that employment statistics could be improved for different subdomains of interest (e.g. age, sex/gender, census geography, economic region) in using small area estimation technique. We will discuss the results and limitations of this work.
The third presentation highlights several aspects of the ONS Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS), which has a longitudinal structure retesting participant to see how swab positivity and antibody positivity change over time.  The CIS represents a very relevant and almost unique experience for official statistics as it provides regular estimates of relevant parameters (infection rate, antibody positivity) related to the spread of the pandemic. It also allows more ad-hoc analysis into aspects such as a more detailed look into re-infections. 
The last presentation focuses on nonresponse and attrition that are among the most significant problems for panel surveys, as they result in loss of data, decreased estimation efficiency, and increased risk of bias in research findings. We analyse in depth and disentangle these two phenomena, and propose an operational definition of attrition that strives to characterize attritors as units with a persistent non-respondent state over time.

This desire was particularly apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic in order for general monitoring of the economy and to support evidence-based decision making. Agencies around the world are evaluating these methods, and a number of competing techniques have been developed. This session will contrast a number of potential models including machine learning models, traditional time series models, and other complex automated models designed specifically for this context.

Meanwhile, many statistical offices are still relying on traditional data sources, such as population censuses and household surveys. These sources, although they remain important as a statistical foundation, they often suffer from challenges, such as delays in data dissemination, reduced data quality due to declining response rate; and lack of granularity to inform targeted policymaking at the local level.   The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and more recently the COVID-19 pandemic, have highlighted the importance of accurate, inclusive, and timely data to inform decision-making. However according to the 2022 SDG report, for 8 of the 17 SDGs, fewer than half of the 193 countries have internationally comparable data since 2015. This calls for innovative approaches to respond to the urgent data needs for local and national policy and decision-making to achieve the 2030 Agenda.   In this context, various partners across civil society, academia, and the private sector, under the Data for Now initiative are working with national statistical offices to develop countries’ capacities to produce, collect, and use innovative data sources and methods for more efficient and targeted policies. The session will discuss the experiences and challenges faced by countries in adopting innovative approaches and invite an exchange between national statistical offices (NSOs) and academic experts on the benefits of stronger collaboration between statistical systems and academia for better use of innovative methods that meet the national needs.   This session will bring together speakers from the national statistical offices, academia, and other partners to: - Share experiences in adopting innovative approaches in countries and discuss challenges and lessons learnt when matching data needs with innovations for official data production - Discuss the need for more research on innovative methods to support low- and middle-income countries, when data access, data availability and technical capacity are often lacking - Review approaches for collaboration between academia and NSSs/NSOs Organiser: Faryal Ahmed  Chair: Francesca Perucci  Speaker: Mr. Leonardo Trujillo Speaker: Ms. Xeni Kristine Dimakos Speaker: Dr Amos Kabo-bah  Speaker: Dr. Babatunde Abidoye Discussant: Mr. Matthew Shearing Discussant: Rebecca Riley",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/345/details/

Added to this complexity is that there are other SDG indicator frameworks at the country, regional and organizations such as SDSN that indicator frameworks which may overlap or contain completely unique indicator sets.   The question of how to measure overall progress then arises. Composite indices, distance-to-targets measures or country rankings have been proposed as alternatives to overcome the excess of information often associated with large indicator sets. However, while composite indices are easy to understand for policy makers, they can mask important changes that may need to be addressed.  Moreover,  in some cases, the weighting of indicators may vary.  And at the extreme, composite indices on the same topics developed for different SDG indicator sets can may provide diametrically different results.  However, composite measures are easy to for policy makers to understand when indicator frameworks are large and complex.  This session will discuss the advantages and shortcomings of composite and distance to targets measures versus  alternative presentations such as dashboards, and in which situations either approach works best.   Organiser:Ms Cara Williams  Chair:Ms Cara Williams  Speaker:Guillaume Cohen  Speaker:Catherine Michaud  Speaker:Live Rognerud  Speaker:Guillaume Lafortune  Discussant: Viveka Palm ",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/310/details/

                 Mr Michael Frosch ","There have been many developments and extensive work on the improvement of the measurement of informality and this session will be an opportunity to highlight the latest developments in the statistical framework of the informal economy and its measurement, as well as sharing leanings. According to the latest global estimates 60 percent of the worlds employed population are in informal employment. This means most workers lack effective coverage of formal arrangements, such as national labour laws and social protection systems put in place to regulate and protect workers, enterprises and their activities. While informal employment creates opportunities to generate income and support livelihood, it has strong links to vulnerability, economic risks and decent work deficits. Links were evident during the COVID-19 pandemic when informal workers were severely impacted by lock-downs and limited access to economic support. Informality also has a strong gender dimension. Women are more often found in the most vulnerable forms of informal employment, for instance as domestic workers, home-based workers or contributing family workers. The informal economy has been a long standing priority for the ILO and its constituents. The first statistical standards defining the informal sector were adopted at the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) in 1993. Ten years later, the boundaries of informality were broadened with the adoption of the Guidelines concerning a statistical definition of informal employment. These standards have contributed to increase measurement of informal employment by countries providing statistics on the different components of the informal economy. Development of a statistical framework for informality has been an incremental process. As a result, despite good progress, there are some flexibilities, gaps, and inconsistencies between and within the different concepts and definitions. In addition, the standards for measuring work, on which the standards for informality were built, have changed in the last decade following introduction of a the concept of work at the ICLS in 2013, recognizing five different forms of work, paid as well as unpaid. One of the most essential objectives of collecting data on informality is to support and monitor policies aimed at improving working conditions in both informal and formal employment. While the dichotomy of informality and formality contributes to this, there is a strong need to provide more granular data that gives a better understanding of the situation of informal and formal workers. At the 20th ICLS in 2018, there was consensus on the need to revise the current standards on informality, to address these and other issues. To assist in this work, the ILO established a working group comprising producers and users of labour and economic statistics from national government agencies in all regions, intergovernmental agencies, and workers’ and employers’ organizations. In addition to a new conceptual framework for measurement, an indicator framework is being developed to support and assist countries in producing policy relevant data on the informal economy. In parallel with revising the statistical standards, the ILO is development of improved data collection methods for the measurement of informal employment. These will support countries to implement the new standards and improve their measurement of informality, particularly with a gender lens. The Engendering Informality Statistics Project, and the Informality in the Arab Region project through which this methodological work is being conducted, allows the testing of improved survey questions as well as the development of additional modules that will contribute to a better understanding of the situation of women and men in the informal economy. The new standards on the informal economy, the supporting indicator framework and the improved data collection tools will all be presented and discussed that the next ICLS taken place in 2023. The 63rd ISI Conference provides a timely opportunity to promote the work being done and explore the impact on the international statistical community. The new measurement framework for the informal economy will harmonise data on informality and encourage regular production and analysis of statistics. For countries currently not measuring the informal economy, the improved framework and tools are an opportunity to start doing so. For countries already producing informality statistics this will support improved measurement and the production of policy relevant indicators.  
The different presentations in the session will explore user perspectives and the changing needs for data on informality. It will outline the features of the new conceptual framework developed by the ILO working group. Partners from national statistical offices will be invited to share their experience in pre-testing methods and contributing to the development of the news measures and tools.

In recent years, attention has turned to how to use the simulators in real-world situations, how to combine simulations with field data or other models to build predictive models, and how to quantify uncertainty in predictions. The need for new statistical methodology for inference using computational models is pressing. The session will be of broad interest because of the variety of applications and methods. Indeed, all talks are impactful insofar as they create new methods for real-world applications In this session, there will be four talks and a panelist to discuss their findings. Each of the talks centers around developing new statistical methodology applied to real-world applications utilizing a computational models. The first talk considers statistical inference for agent-based models to assess potential mitigation and/or public policy strategies. In particular, describing and accounting for uncertainty in analyses impose d by the use of generated (not true) populations remains a difficult task. This work was heavily used during the global pandemic. The second talk presents methodology for computer model emulation when simulators are used in a sequence (i.e., the output of one simulator is the input of the next). A new deep Gaussian process formulation is presented to model a complex climate simulator, and allow for fast exploration of climate outcomes. The third talk considers the use of auto-encoders (a type of neural net) as a statistical emulator of a climate model. This approach is motivated by the need to have fast prediction of simulator output for large-scale simulator residing on a super computer. Finally, the last talk develops new deep Gaussian process methodology for modeling non-stationary behavior in hurricane models. The methods will be compared and contrasted by an expert panelist.

Supported by the and Welcome Trust and the Fogarty International Heath NIH grants, respectively, the Sub-Saharan Africa Consortium for Advanced Biostatistics Training (SSACAB) and the Stellenbosch MSc in Biostatistics Program, were designed to: 1. Develop, strengthen and implement high quality biostatistics graduate training; 2. Develop expertise, skills, and research leaders of biostatistics in Sub-Saharan Africa; 3. Build a sustainable network of biostatisticians and statistically informed researchers through outreach, and mentoring; and 4. Integrate with International Biostatistics Societies and National Statistical Societies to produce a cadre of internationally trained African biostatisticians. This has been a partnership among several universities in the region and in the North, and national and international funding agencies. The objective of this session is to share experiences about how these endeavors were approached, the successes and challenges todate, the lessons learnt, and the funders’ perspectives, about how to build capacity in clinical trial methodology in resource-stricken settings.

                 Christie Sambell ","Official Statistics needs to innovate continuously in order to stay relevant and gain agility. New technologies are key enablers for this. New architectures allow rapid changes and continuous deployment at scale and using open source solutions allow to maximise its reuse. This session will aim at reviewing recent initiatives harnessing cloud technologies built on open source solutions in the context of official statistics and discuss opportunities for National Statistical Institutes to collaborate to realise economies of scale.   All over the world, there is a continuous need for a flexible environment where statisticians and data scientist can use the latest technologies to create new innovative products. To fulfil these requests several initiatives were launched around the globe, just to name a few: -Data science campus, ONS (https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk) -Advance Analytics Workspace, StatCan (https://statcan.github.io/daaas/en/) -Onyxia, INSEE (https://github.com/inseefrlab/onyxia) -EC Data Platform (https://ec-europa.github.io/digit-dataplatform/) -Cloudlab, Eurostat (https://github.com/eurostat/datalab)   Many of these projects are using cloud based technologies and built on open source solutions for possible reuse by the statistical community. The session would review some of these initiatives providing the guiding principles of technological choices and the limitations of the different solutions. The session would provide a chance to discuss best practices, new trends and possible opportunities for National Statistical Institutes and international scientific community to collaborate in order to realise economies of scale.   The session can be divided in two parts, with a series of brief presentations by the speakers followed by a panel discussion between the speakers moderated by a discussant or the chair. Alternatively, depending on the number of speakers, the session could comprise only the presentation of ongoing projects with no panel discussion.   Potential speakers are the developers or project managers of the above listed solutions and the discussant can be one of the member of the UNECE 2022 Machine Learning group working on IT infrastructure (https://statswiki.unece.org/display/ML/Machine+Learning+Group+2022).     Organiser:Mr Mátyás Mészáros  Chair:Monica Pickard  Speaker:Mr Romain Lesur  Speaker:Ms Marie Haldorson Speaker: Christie Sambell   Discussant: Albrecht Wirthmann ",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/331/details/

                 Thomas Loredo ","The field of Astrostatistics has been growing rapidly over the past decade,  with advanced statistical methods entering the standard techniques broadly used by astronomers.  Several astrostatistics associations have been established over this period with the primary  goal of fostering interdisciplinary collaborations. Such collaborations have resulted in advancing both the analysis of astronomical data as well as statistical methodology.  Astronomical data pose unique challenges to statisticians: analysis requires understanding the systematics in the data collection process, contaminating factors, and the behavior of instruments, an ability to handle signals with large dynamic range and complex hierarchical models, and a recognition that data acquisition is often not a repeatable or reproducible process.These challenges resulted in developments of new statistical methods, e.g., improvements in MCMC sampling strategies in reaction to complex astrophysical parameter spaces, establishing the magnitudes of corrections to instrument calibration even in the absence of an absolute reference, developing multi-stage strategies to account for systematic uncertainties present in atomic data and instrument calibration, computing change points in 4-dimensional data cubes, spatial segmentations in unbinned data, disambiguating photons from overlapping sources, etc.The goals of the proposed session are to highlight new results originating from ongoing collaborative research, increase awareness of astronomical data problems among statisticians, and foster collaborations between astronomers and statisticians. The invited speakers are from diverse geographical locations and include statisticians and astronomers who have been involved in active astrostatistics collaborations.They will provide their perspective on astrostatistics research and present case studies of several astronomical data problems and how they developed working solutions. The confirmed speakers and the topics of presentations: Jogesh Babu is a statistician who has been working with astronomers for more than three decades and witnessed formations of the astrostatistics associations.  He along with his astronomer colleague Eric Feigelson coined the term “Astrostatistics” when they published a book by the same title in 1996. He will present a historical perspective on a rapid growth of astrostatistics.   Yang Chen is a statistician representing the ASA Astrostatistics Interest Group. She will present statistical issues in instrument calibration and discuss ML methods to determine solar flare propensity. David Van Dyk is a statistician and a founding member of CHASC astrostatistics collaboration and will highlight CHASC activities. Gwendolyn Eadie is an astrostatistician and will discuss the status of astrostatistics in Canada. She will also highlight recent work in her interdisciplinary research group including Bayesian inference for analysis of star clusters and understanding bias resulting from data collection, functional principal component analysis for studying stellar chemical composition, and spatial point process models for discovering new galaxies. Thomas Loredo is an astrostatistician and has been a co-chair of the Rubin Observatory LSST Informatics and Statistics Science Collaboration. He will highlight results of the competition challenges organized by the LSST ISSC such as time-series classification, time-delay, and tomography challenges. This proposal comes from the Council of the International Astrostatistics Association (IAA; http://iaa.mi.oa-brera.inaf.it/IAA/home.html) and is supported by ISI Astrostatistics Special Interest Group (https://www.isi-web.org/isi-community/committees/astrostatistics), which has representatives from sister organizations: IAU, IEEE, ASA, and AAS.   Organiser:Aneta Siemiginowska  Chair:Vinay Kashyap  Speaker:Jogesh Babu  Speaker:Gwendolyn Eadie  Speaker:David Stenning  Speaker:Yang Chen  Speaker: Thomas Loredo ",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/312/details/

                 Dr Ron Jarmin ; Andrea Diniz da Silva ","National Statistics Institutes (NSIs) are facing numerous challenges. Although surveys have served as a solid foundation for producing official statistics for more than 50 years, increasing costs, decreasing response rates, and decreasing list frame coverage are raising concerns about the quality of the resulting estimates. At the same time, data users are wanting more official statistics reported at finer temporal and spatial scales. In the era of big data, administrative and other data are becoming increasingly available. Consequently, many NSIs are actively moving to either integrate survey and non-survey data or to use only non-survey data to produce official statistics. In this session, speakers from four different countries will discuss the progress being made and the problems yet to be solved if NSIs are to truly leverage all available data in the production of official statistics. Anders Holmberg, Australian Bureau of Statistics, will focus on ways to find a balance between cost efficient statistics production and the thirst for timely data analytics, while acknowledging the paradoxes and trade-offs. Ron Jarmin, U.S. Census Bureau, will discuss bridging the gap between theory and practice when using all available data, including how building statistics for the retail trade sector from transaction level data can yield fundamental improvements in both price and quantity measurement, the investments in statistical infrastructure needed leverage the value of private sector data, and issues that require solutions to scale the use of these data for official statistics. Ton de Waal, Statistics Netherlands, will explore some of the theoretical challenges when using diverse data, such as measuring the quality of estimates (partly) based on non-probability data with a focus on assessing selection bias in practical situations and on assessing the effect of measurement error on the quality of estimates. Andrea Diniz da Silva, Brazil's Escola Nacional de Ciencias Estatisticas - ENCE, will highlight recent achievements of the Regional Hub for Big Data in Brazil, one of four regional hubs created by the United Nations to provide support to NSIs, for training and fostering the interest of young statisticians on the use of big data and for the practices and challenges regarding the use of big data for statistics in Latin America and the Caribbean Region. Linda J. Young, USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, will discuss the common issues identified by the four speakers and potential opportunities for collaboration as NSIs move rapidly to improve estimates using all available information. Leveraging all data in the production of official statistics: A progress report Speaker 1: Anders Holmberg, Australian Bureau of Statistics Title: Longer, wider, more granular, frenetic and recycled, can NSIs pivot to exploit more and different data and meet new demands? Abstract: National statistical institutes (NSIs) stepped up during the pandemic and delivered new timely statistics accessing new data sources. This traded timeliness for accuracy provided governments with valuable facts to make better policy decisions. In my view, this was helped by being prepared from a long and (according to some) slow progress moving away from direct data collections to more comfortably using secondary data sources. In parallel NSIs are transitioning to roles as not only collectors and producers of data, but also curators and providers of data for advanced policy analysis purposes. NSIs are increasingly providing platforms for safe use and analysis of microdata. My talk will focus on ways to find a balance between having cost efficient statistics production and quenching the thirst for timely data analytics. There are paradoxes and trade-offs that NSIs must acknowledge and I shall highlight some of them and outline how traditional sample surveys still have an important role.  Speaker 2: Ron Jarmin, U.S. Census Bureau  Title: Modernizing Official Statistics in Theory and Practice  Abstract: Statistical agencies are driven to modernize both by challenges to existing methods (e.g., declining survey response rates) and by emerging opportunities (e.g., the proliferation of new digital source data).  I discuss recent progress at the U.S. Census Bureau.  I provide an overview of successful applications of blended data to improve economic indicators and mitigate the impact of data collection challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.  I highlight research showing that building statistics for the retail trade sector from transaction level data can yield fundamental improvements in both price and quantity measurement.  I outline foundational investments in statistical infrastructure needed leverage the value of private sector data and discuss access and engineering issues that need solutions to scale the use these data for official statistics.  Speaker 3: Ton de Waal, Statistics Netherlands  Title: Measuring Quality of Official Statistics (partly) Based on Non-Probability Data  Abstract: In recent years, non-probability data, i.e. data not collected by means of a known and well-designed sampling mechanism such as administrative data and big data, are more and more used for producing official statistics. In some cases official statistics are based on non-probability data solely, in other cases official statistics are based on a combination of non-probability data and traditional sample survey data. When official statistics are (partly) based on non-probability data, assessment of the quality of estimates for parameters of interest is usually much more complicated than when such estimates are based on sample survey data only. For instance, administrative data and big data are sometimes based on a selective part of the population, which may lead to selection bias in estimates for parameters of interest. Also, when estimates are based on several datasets – either non-probability datasets or survey samples – in which the same target variable is measured, measurement error in this variable may become apparent and needs to be assessed. In this talk we will discuss measuring the quality of estimates (partly) based on non-probability data. We will focus on assessing selection bias in practical situations and on assessing the effect of measurement error on the quality of estimates. Speaker 4: Andrea Diniz da Silva, Brazil’s Escola Nacional de Ciências Estatísticas – ENCE Title: Use of Big Data in Official Statistics: State of Art in Latin American and the Caribbean  Abstract: Big data is more and more successfully used by many national statistical offices as alternative to traditional survey data. The United Nations Global Platform registered at least 111 national experiences on using web scraping, mobile phone data, social media and satellite imagery, among other sources, to produce a broad number of statistics including on prices, migration, agriculture, mobility and indicators for at least SDGs 1, 2, 5, 6, 11, 14 and 15. To support national statistical offices, the United Nations created four regional hubs: Brazil, China, United Arab Emirates and Rwanda. The Regional Hub for Big Data in Brazil, which serves Latin America and the Caribbean, has been developing several actions to promote training and fostering the interest of young statisticians on the use of big data, to support sharing of experiences and knowledge and to strengthen ties and promote cooperation in the Region. The presentation will provide an overview on the recent achievements resulting of the Hub’s activities as well as on the practices and challenges regarding the use of big data for statistics in the Region as reported by the national statistical offices answering a consultation conducted at the beginning of 2023.   Discussant: Linda J.

This challenges information providers and statistical authorities to develop their services, taking into account the needs of the society and, finally, the end users of statistics. This session sheds light on the new challenges and opportunities of information production and, using case examples, brings out the services and ways in which statistical data can be used to support decision making. The session is suggested as a joint session of IASE and IAOS. Its organiser is the ISLP (International Statistical Literacy Project).     Statistics and data in the decision-making process – how can statistical offices promote the usage and application of data? Knowledge-based decision-making requires constructing a bigger picture combining different sources of information. The decision-maker needs statistics to maintain a situational picture and to evaluate the consequences of decisions. An understanding of societal structures, nowcasting and predicting is necessary. On the other hand, statistics make it possible to map out and compare different options, anticipate effects and evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of different measures. The first task of an information provider is to bring statistics to use and offer enough of them in a comprehensive and understandable format. The society – all the way from citizens to the decision-makers – needs reliable statistical information about different phenomena. On one hand, there is a need for finalized and thoroughly checked statistical information and time series, but on the other hand, there is equally large need for rapid release and experimental statistics. Many advanced  users only need a proper interface and as much data as possible. Whereas further analyses data becomes one of the central questions. Who produces the analysing services? Is it a task for the national statistical offices, research institution or collaborative effort between the aforementioned actors? What are the roles of different operators in accelerated information production? What real time data services should information providers and national statistical offices offer to the decision-makers? Ultimately, the decision-maker also needs some understanding of how statistics and data can be used, what are their limitations and possibilities. What other data can be used to complement statistical data to create a bigger picture? Statistical literacy is a key social and working life skill and its promotion is one of the key strategic tasks of statistical offices. How do we advance this mission? It is also important to know the users' real information needs. In what context and for what purpose is the data used?  The topic is also considered from the viewpoint of low resources environments. This session sheds light on the new challenges and opportunities of information production and, using case examples, brings out the services and ways in which statistical data can be used to support decision making. The need for accelerated but still reliable information is increasing all the time.  Decision-makers need information in an understandable and analyzed form to different channels, one example being GIS (Spatial data) technology, which supports the analysis of statistics based on the spatial dimension. This challenges information providers and statistical authorities to develop their services, taking into account the needs of the society and, finally, the end users of statistics.

                 Ms Milica Maricic ; PROF. DR. Eva Laczka ","Women's participation in statistical research increased substantially in the past few decades. However, the share in the highest leadership positions remains low. Contemporary statistical research enters a phase of rapid development owing to the fast-growing possibilities offered using novel information technologies and the increased need of society for more and more complex analyses of massive data relevant to various economic and social activities, which provides large opportunities for women to be an important part of this. Further increase in the involvement of women in statistical research is crucial both for the development of statistical research and for the empowerment of women by increasing their role in society. An example of a career of a unique pioneer in statistics, such as the extraordinary biography of Florence Nightingale David, may highly inspire women to enter statistical research. Making visible the contribution of women may create further motivation for entering statistical research and taking leadership roles on research teams or in statistical organizations related to different activity types, e. g. in governmental statistics or statistical societies, etc. Particular attention is to be paid to the motivation of female students to choose the direction of their career in statistics and data science, crucial for statistical research, by stimulating interest in statistics among women and encouraging female students in schools and colleges to study statistics by presenting the successful examples of women in statistics. All this is presented either through indicators, descriptions, and evidence-based reasoning provided for different countries, or a valuable experience of a biography of a distinguishing woman statistician, so covering the history and contemporary conditions, and providing a very wide perspective of women in statistics issues.

The contextual examples will be from multiple countries, showing the intricacies of the natural language processing and computations involved just to coupling the information from the data with traditional surveys. Then they will highlight the use of such interesting auxiliary information in small area statistics. Methodological developments as well as real data examples will be presented. Another speaker will then discuss the use of purposive sampling and non-probability sampling in the context of agricultural surveys and agricultural statistics. Here, some of the challenges involved require doubly robust inferential schemes and risk assessment, and methodological developments as well as case studies would be presented. Another presenter will highlight the use of empirical likelihood-based techniques in the context of doubly robust estimation using non-probability samples. Traditional approaches for using empirical likelihood do not extend easily when the sampling strategy is not driven by a probabilistic mechanism, and theoretical discussions as well and real data studies will be demonstrated. Another speaker will discuss the use of Bayesian network-driven small area modeling methodology when data from both non-probability and probability survey samples are combined. Certain interesting robustness features of this Bayesian approach would be highlighted. Using both theoretical results and real data case studies, the speaker will discuss how networks can be very informative auxiliary information for small area studies. We expect that the methodological advances as well as the real data examples from all the speakers would be of interest to many participants, and they would find useful information to take away and apply in other statistical applications as well.   Organiser:Dr Snigdhansu Chatterjee  Chair: Dr Snigdhansu Chatterjee Speaker:Ms Haoyi Chen  Speaker:Dr Snigdhansu Chatterjee Speaker:Dr Sanjay Chaudhuri  Discussant:  Prof. Mahmoud Torabi ",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/325/details/
 19 July 2023,Wednesday,10:00,12:00,IPS 317 - Measurement challenges of digitalization in official statistics,IPS Room 215,Category: IPS,,,"The digital economy increasingly intertwining with the traditional economy, has created some new measurement challenges for macroeconomic statistics and may have exacerbated some older ones. This is known as the “mismeasurement hypothesis”. There are significant concerns that the production and benefits of digitalization may not be appropriately reflected in official statistics. Statistical agencies are typically unable to well measure the output that results from the introduction of new goods and services. This has been making responses by the international statistics community, for example, OECD-IMF collaboration has made efforts to address immediate concerns about the potential scale of GDP mismeasurement in key areas where mismeasurement is often suspected. Another bunch of studies on the digital economy focuses on challenges to mismeasurement for the productivity slowdown. The productivity slowdown has occurred in dozens of countries, and a number of commentators and researchers have suggested that this slowdown is at least in part illusory because real output data have failed to capture the new and better products of the past decade. To challenge the mismeasurement in the digital economy, the session especially pays attention to the important measurement challenges in official statistics. The digital economy has raised some concerns about the scope and estimation of GDP. The digital economy’s output captured in estimates of GDP is still lacking. The research work is needed on measuring the contributions of digitalisation to GDP and other macroeconomic statistics. Digitalisation is not sufficiently present within the classification systems currently used to estimate and report on economic activity, making it difficult to assess the size and growth of the digital economy and its possible contributions to consumer welfare. In addition, the employment impacts of digitalization, including the rise of the ’sharing’ and ’gig’ economies, raise important issues for labour market policies. Working on a more explicit view of the digital economy in macroeconomic statistics is also important because further investigation could uncover significant measurement challenges in activities that have not been fully investigated but whose economic size could grow and create measurement biases in the future. The productivity slowdown that occurred in dozens of countries resulting from the “missing output” still needs empirical challenges. Whether its size or output is related to measures of the countries’ consumption or production intensities of information and communication technologies (ICTs, the type of goods most often cited as sources of mismeasurement) and the surplus created by internet-linked digital technologies is still not clear. More empirical analysis based on countries’ data should be carried out to examine the properly measured output and productivity growth rates of industries.

                 Prof. Eric Kolaczyk ","Recent advances in computing and measurement technologies have led to an explosion in the amount of data that are being collected in all areas of application. Much of these data have complex structure, in the form of text, images, video, audio, streaming data, and so on. The proposed session focuses on one important class of problems, viz, data with network structures. Such data are common in diverse engineering and scientific areas, such as biology, computer science, economics, business, epidemiology, sociology and so on. As a consequence, research on networks has steadily increased in recent years, and has also appeared in leading science publications. For example, Nature has published several reviews on the subject, Science and PNAS devoted special issues to it. While there has been extensive research on networks and practical successes, much of it happen outside the field of Statistics, and our theoretical and methodological understanding of their statistical properties is still limited. This offers statisticians numerous open questions and opportunities to be involved and allows statisticians to play critical roles. The scope of the invited talks in the proposed session ranges from characterizing and modeling network structures based on statistical principles, to exploiting the network structure as additional information to develop statistical learning methods, as well as applications to understand political partisan polarization in social media interactions among both political elites and the public. The four speakers and one discussant (including three males and two females) in the proposed session are a mixture of outstanding early- and mid- career statisticians, who come from different geographic locations (three are from the U.S., one from Canada, and one from Europe) and have extensive experience in computing, theory, methodology and applications. It is my belief that in order for the statistics community to grow healthily, it is vital to provide opportunities for the early- and mid- career statisticians to disseminate their research findings. The four invited speakers will present their most recent progresses in the area of statistical network analysis and provide new directions from the statistical perspective. The discussant will provide professional and constructive criticisms and raise issues for broader consideration as a way to connect the invited talks. Their unique insights will be valuable to the broad scientific community working on cutting-edge network problems.   Speaker: Eric Kolaczyk
Title: Coevolving Latent Space Network with Attractors Models for Polarization
Abstract: We develop a broadly applicable class of coevolving latent space network with attractors (CLSNA) models, where nodes represent individual social actors assumed to lie in an unknown latent space, edges represent the presence of a specified interaction between actors, and attractors are added in the latent level to capture the notion of attractive and repulsive forces. We apply the CLSNA models to understand the dynamics of partisan polarization on social media, where we expect US Republicans and Democrats to increasingly interact with their own party and disengage with the opposing party. Our analysis confirms the existence of partisan polarization in social media interactions among both political elites and the public. Moreover, while attractive partisanship is the driving force of interactions across the full periods of study for both the public and Democratic elites, repulsive partisanship has come to dominate Republican elites' interactions since the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.

Title: Learning Network Properties without Network Data -- A Correlated Network Scale-up Model
Abstract: The network scale-up method based on ""how many X's do you know?"" questions has gained popularity in estimating the sizes of hard-to-reach populations. The success of the method relies primarily on the easy nature of the data collection and the flexibility of the procedure, especially since the model does not require a sample from the target population, a major limitation of traditional size estimation models. In this talk, we propose a new network scale-up model which incorporates respondent and subpopulation covariates in a regression framework, includes a bias term that more accurately estimates response biases under fewer assumptions, and adds a correlation structure between subpopulations. In addition to estimating the unknown population sizes, our proposed model depicts people's social network patterns in an aggregated level without using the network data. Speaker: Gongjun Xu
Title: High-dimensional Factor Analysis for Network-linked Data
Abstract: Factor analysis is a widely used statistical tool in many scientific fields, including psychology, economics, and sociology. Meanwhile, observations connected by a network are becoming increasingly common, and how to incorporate the network structure in factor analysis remains an open question. Focusing on high-dimensional factor analysis with network-connected observations, we propose a generalized factor model with latent factors capturing both the network structure and the dependence structure among the high-dimensional variables. We develop a computationally efficient estimation procedure and establish asymptotic inferential theories. In particular, we show that by borrowing information from the network, the proposed estimator of the factor loading matrix achieves the optimal asymptotic variance under much milder identifiability constraints than the existing literature. Speaker: Yi Yu
Title: Change Point Localisation in Dynamic Multilayer Random Dot Product Graphs
Abstract: In this talk we are concerned with change point localisation in a dynamic multilayer network, which is modelled through a sequence of random dot product graphs in tensor forms, with temporal dependence and cross-layer dependence. We will demonstrate the minimax optimality of our proposed change point estimators and support the theoretical findings through extensive numerical experiments.

                 Dr Kalinda Elizabeth Griffiths ","The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in over half a billion cases and over six million deaths worldwide. In the United States, preliminary estimates indicate that nearly two years of life expectancy have been lost due to Covid-19, with disparately greater effects among racial and ethnic minorities. Covid-19 has hit Indigenous communities especially hard. This session will examine preliminary mortality data among Indigenous peoples in the countries (US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand) represented in the International Group for Indigenous Health Measurement (IGIHM). The analysis will include a focus on excess deaths due to Covid. This session builds on past work analyzing information on how Indigenous communities have fared in the pandemic. These countries have experienced different waves at different times and have different vaccination efforts and coverages. Yet, Indigenous peoples in these countries are unique within their respective countries, due to greater heath disparities and, often, greater community resilience. These factors will be reflected in Indigenous mortality rates compared to the general population in their respective countries. Specifically, four papers will be presented from the four IGIHM countries with a fifth analyzing differences in mortality and mortality measures among the four countries. KEYWORDS: Indigenous peoples, COVID-19, Mortality rates, Health measurement, International Group for Indigenous Health Measurement   This session will explore the recent mortality experience of the Indigenous peoples of the four countries, with a particular focus on the impact of covid-19.  The four countries present interesting contrasts in experience, ranging from the enormous number of covid-19 deaths - both Indigenous and non-Indigenous - in the United States to relatively small numbers of deaths in Australia and New Zealand.  The speakers will review the various Indigenous risk factors that make Indigenous populations particularly at-risk for covid-19 infection.  Speakers also will present data on the very different experiences across countries in vaccination coverage and availability of various types of vaccine.  They will explore the advantage held by island nations in establishing a national quarantine.  The presentations will consider some advantages that Indigenous populations possess in dealing with covid-19, such as the use of tribal hierarchy in winning acceptance of covid-19 vaccine.   The presentations will also describe the many other health challenges of these Indigenous populations, including significant differences in life expectancy as compared to the non-Indigenous populations of each country.  The presentations will also consider the many statistical challenges inherent in any attempt to measure Indigenous mortality, including the difficulties in establishing Indigenous identity and the small number problems inherent in these small populations, among others.  As for covid-19 mortality in particular, the lack of access to health care for Indigenous, in particular in the United States, presents a special challenge in determining the actual impact of covid-19.  Some of the presentations will include an analysis of excess deaths as a means of estimating the true impact of covid-19 on Indigenous mortality.

Teaching and Learning Statistics during the covid-19 pandemic – In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic afforded the schooling and tertiary education communities to move to alternative ways of teaching and learning statistics, reducing the face-to-face activities to a minimum level, particularly at the tertiary level. Africa was at the epicentre of this change, where many institutions moved decisively into remote and online teaching with alternative approaches to assessing learning in statistics. New communities of practice amongst students and academics emerged, embracing the evolution of e-learning and online instruction. However, this came with different challenges, depending on the level of learning (schooling versus tertiary level, first-year versus third-year tertiary level classes) and the class size (more than 1,000 and less than 50). Therefore, solutions to the challenges require careful thinking and planning to provide opportunities for the students to achieve the best learning outcomes without making it too onerous for academics.   The introduction of development programs in statistics education in Africa is an ongoing process.

On one hand, SDGs 2 and 4 address poverty, hunger, and malnutrition globally, to be achieved by 2030, with SDG 2 specifically addressing food insecurity by decreasing chronic hunger, defined as a situation that occurs when people do not have access to enough nutritious food for an active and healthy life. On the other hand, and almost in contrast to this, SDG 12 (goal 12.3) aims to halve food waste at the retail and household level by 2030, as food waste burdens waste management systems and exacerbates food insecurity. Global data underline the urgency of taking concerted action to reduce this mismatch. It emerges that about 10% of the world's total population struggles to meet the most basic needs and thus lives in extreme poverty (UN, 2020). In fact, even before COVID-19, baseline projections suggested that around 6% of the world's population would still be living in extreme poverty in 2030, thus missing the established SDG targets. These projections were exceeded due to the COVID-19 pandemic, pushing more than 70 million people worldwide into extreme poverty in 2020 (UN, 2020), with the total rising to 150 million in 2021 (World Bank, 2021).  In contrast, one third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted (Gustavsson et al, 2011; UNEP, 2021) generating significant economic, environmental, and social impacts, with estimates suggesting that 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions are associated with unconsumed food (UNEP, 2021). Therefore, in the context of food resource management, the joint need of improving individuals' access and affordability of food - thus ensuring adequate nutrition and healthy eating - and of reducing food waste – occurring mainly at the household level - should be straightaway addressed by counteracting what has been called in the literature as the paradox of “scarcity in abundance” (Campiglio and Rovati, 2019), where a percentage of the population facing food scarcity coexists with food wastage (Secondi et al, 2015), overproduction and abundant food availability (Stringer, 2016). At the same time, it is necessary to gather reliable and accurate data, through sample surveys or new data sources (such as big data) and/or to exploit the potential of existing official data to get a clear picture and constant monitoring of both access to food and thus food security/insecurity  (Beacom, 2022) and its efficient management, trying to minimize food waste.  The aim of this session is to jointly present and discuss the contrasting phenomena of food poverty and food insecurity by providing an overview for different territorial contexts (Mexico, Italy and Sweden) and exploiting the potentials of both primary data (collected through ad hoc surveys), web scraping and official statistical data sources.  On one hand, the contributions in this session will focus on the ability of individuals to access food, measured through data collected in official sample surveys (i.e. official surveys on income and household expenditure) as well as new data sources focusing on the phenomena of food affordability, poverty, and food insecurity. On the other hand, the issue of food waste will be presented with a view to its sustainable management through digital tools whose traceability and constant monitoring could guarantee a more effective control and thus a reduction, towards the goals set by the 2030 Agenda. The session will be organized with the presentation of four papers and their analysis by a discussant.  Then the floor will be opened for discussion by participants. The first paper “Measuring Economic Access to Food and Insecurity through Official Statistics. Qualitative and quantitative scales in the Mexican context” by Stefano Marchetti (University of Pisa, Italy), Gaia Bertarelli (Sant'Anna - School of Advanced Studies, Pisa) and Adrian Vargas-Lopez (Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico) will focus on the measurement of economic access to food in Mexico and specifically on measuring food (in)security and food poverty using official statistical data at different territorial levels. By referring to the official National Survey of Household Income and Expenditure (ENIGH) carried out every two years in Mexico by the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics (INEGI), this contribution will explore the comparability of qualitative and quantitative (headline) approaches and indicators to be used as a useful tool to constantly monitor these issues. Indeed, food insecurity level measured using both qualitative and quantitative scales can show different picture of the phenomenon, and here we investigate such differences. The paper will be presented by Stefano Marchetti (University of Pisa, Italy). The second paper “Food affordability in Italy: an empirical study using big data sources” (Benedetti, Crescenzi, Laureti, Palumbo) will address the issue of economic access to food in Italy in terms of Spatial Price Indexes estimated at detailed territorial levels by using both official scanner and web-scraped data.  Scanner data, which include data of turnover and quantities for each product code sold in each outlet, have been provided by Italian National statistical Institute for the years 2019 and 2021. Scanner data refers to outlets belonging the modern retail chains located in all the Italian provinces in the most important 21 retail chains. The sample of outlets has been selected from the Nielsen universe, represented by 21 chains (out of 25) and about 29,000 outlets, covering more than 90% of total turnover of the modern distribution in Italy. This universe is stratified by province (107) and outlet type (hypermarkets, supermarkets, discounts, small retailers and specialist drugstores). On the other hand, web-scraped data refer to more than 460 supermarkets located in 19 Italian regions collected from February 2021. These data include price, retail chain and outlet, city and detailed information on each product (eg. brand, package size). Various weighted index formulas will be used for obtaining accurate measurement of food affordability in Italian provinces thus providing policy makers with useful tools to support their policy-making processes. The paper will be presented by Ilaria Benedetti (University of Tuscia). The third paper – “Countering food waste through digital tools: statistical analysis at different territorial levels” by Luca Secondi (University of Tuscia, Italy), Ludovica Principato (Roma Tre University), Luigi Palumbo (University of Tuscia and Bank of Italy), Mengting Yu (University of Tuscia, Italy) will explore the possibility of achieving a sustainable food management by focusing on specific issues of meals purchased or consumed out-of-home. The collected data, obtained through digital tools, apps and web-scraping processes will be used to track and monitor the purchase of discounted food and products to be consumed/eaten at home as well as whether the leftover food taken out by consumers from restaurants is consumed or not at home, thus understanding the effectiveness of meal boxes and doggy-bag as effective tools to obtain a responsible and optimal food management. The results will be presented for selected subnational contexts in Italy by using machine learning classification algorithms.  The paper will be presented by Mengting Yu (University of Tuscia and Luibao Limited - Managing director – HK). The fourth paper “Optimizing food management in school canteens: evidence from Sweden” by Mattias Eriksson (Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Sweden), Luca Secondi (University of Tuscia, Italy), Stefano Marchetti (University of Pisa, Italy) and Christian Malefors (Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Sweden) will focus on sustainable management of food resources in Sweden with specific reference to food produced and consumed within public service canteens with a twofold perspective. On one hand, we will aim at understanding the quality of the data that are collected at territorial level in terms of sampling and territorial coverage, thus assessing the accuracy of the information that is transmitted to official statistics offices. On the other hand, we will explore the potential of forecasting methods and algorithms to rationalize food planning and obtaining accurate predictions of food production planning in Swedish public-school canteens, therefore improving organization and management, and ultimately reducing food waste generation. The paper will be presented by Luca Secondi (University of Tuscia, Italy). The presentation of the papers will be followed by the analysis of the discussant, Tiziana Laureti (University of Tuscia, Italy).  SHORT BIOS OF THE PRESENTERS, DISCUSSANT AND CHAIR Stefano Marchetti is Associate Professor of Statistics at the University of Pisa.

Food Security, 13(1), 13-24. (2021) The session “Food access, poverty and food waste: new facets, statistical sources and analysis towards a sustainable management” might be of interest to many WSC attendees, including those working with official statistics - because access to food and its responsible management and consumption represent more than one objective and target of the SDGs Agenda which has served as a call to action for world nations to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure economic, social, and environmental sustainability by 2030 - as well as those working with survey statistics - since  survey statisticians can greatly contribute to refine and improve the process of data collection, availability and representativeness, which are essential to have a clear and accurate monitoring of the two phenomena, also at sub-nationality level - and also those researchers working on experimental sources of statistical data, policy advisors and practitioners. However, despite positive signs such as reducing relative income inequalities in some countries and assigning preferential trade status to lower-income countries, inequalities still exist.
In this framework, measuring access to basic needs, also using official statistics, allows tracking the ability of households or individuals to access food, which is one of the most important aspects of poverty to assess inequalities, thus linking poverty with health and social outcomes.  Poverty and food insecurity may seem to refer exclusively to developing countries, but in fact it is a phenomenon that is also present in developed and rich countries (Hossain et al., 2021; Zaçe et al., 2021), including Europe (Beacom et al., 2020; Penne & Goedemé, 2021, Secondi and Marchetti, 2022) even before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.
On the other hand, food waste represents a surplus of food production that generates approximately 2.6 trillion USD per year, including 700 billion USD in environmental costs and 900 billion USD in social costs (FAO, 2014) and therefore succeeding in reducing food waste offers multifaceted benefits for people and the planet, improving food security, addressing climate change, saving money, and reducing pressures on land, water, biodiversity and waste management systems (UNEP, 2021). 
For these reasons, it is necessary to have as clear and detailed a picture as possible of these phenomena and through the use of official statistics (Secondi and Marchetti, 2022)  as well as exploring the potential of existing sample surveys on household income and consumption expenditure (Beacom, 2022) once the dimensions of the problem have been outlined and constant monitoring framed, it will be possible to identify tools that - also through digitalisation - can enable effective and sustainable food management, by avoiding waste and reallocating the necessary resources, saving nutritious food to be redistributed to those in need, helping to eradicate hunger and malnutrition. 
Therefore, the presentation of the above-mentioned contributions will allow for a more in-depth discussion on the methods and tools to be used to monitor these phenomena.   Organiser:PROF. EM.

                 PROF. DR. Chihiro Shimizu ","In the wake of the financial crisis, commercial property price indexes (CPPIs) were identified as an important gap in the data available for monetary policy and financial stabilization. Although national statistics offices (NSOs) have begun to develop CPPIs, there are many challenges. Commercial properties are quite heterogeneous, and transactions are often irregular, particularly in recession-hit markets, so constructing an index that simply tracks the average transaction price of a sample of fixed-quality properties is generally not feasible. Furthermore, the frequency of repeat sales may be too low to implement repeat-sales methods, which are based on successive transactions in the same property. Indexes compiled in the private sector have typically been based on appraisals, but appraisals may suffer from subjectivity, as well as smoothing and lagging behind market price developments. In addition, one of the things CPPIs are needed for is national accounts measurement, and for this purpose, the indicators of price change must be disaggregated into land and structures. Experts on price measurement representing academia and NSOs who are working on developing new approaches to the compilation of CPPIs will present and discuss research on overcoming these challenges in compiling CPPIs. They share a common goal – to develop a framework for measurement of CPPIs as official statistics.   Methods that are feasible for national statistics offices to implement for constructing commercial property price indexes (CPPIs) must overcome many challenges. Tracking the evolution of the average transaction price for a fixed-quality bundle of properties is generally not feasible. Furthermore, the frequency of repeat sales may be too low to implement repeat-sales methods, which are based on successive transactions in the same property. Typically, indices compiled in the private sector have been based on appraisals, but appraisals may suffer from subjectivity, as well as smoothing and lagging behind market price developments. Methods for constructing CPPIs from transactions data are therefore developed and demonstrated. Methods for decomposing the change in the CPPI into changes in the land prices and changes in structure prices are also tested. This decomposition is needed for national accounts purposes.   Organiser:Marshall Reinsdorf  Chair:Marshall Reinsdorf  Speaker:PROF. DR.

The singular reason for this is to maximise economic productivity which will result in good quality of life among all. SDG 8 craved the fulfilment of the promotion of sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. The International Labour Organisation [ILO] (2019) outlined decent work in the context of gender equality to include: equality of opportunity and treatment, equality of remuneration and access to safe and healthy working environment, equality in association and collective bargaining, equality in obtaining meaningful career development, maternity protection and balance between work and family life that is fair to both men and women. Engaging women in decent work and empowering them is very crucial to the Sub-Saharan Africa’s nosediving economy because it will be inclusive of both gender and that is needed to positively change the present odious situation. Unfortunately, this is still far from being achieved because women who are up to half (50.1%) of the region’s population are not given an enabled environment to thrive and contribute to national development through decent works. Fewer number of women in the region are engaged in formal labour force while the majority are into informal and vulnerable employment including unpaid care and domestic chores. This situation prevents them from managerial positions and decision-making process as well as limit their economic and psychological wellbeing. Justification: Statisticians and WSC attendees from Low-and-Middle-Income Countries including Sub-Saharan Africans will benefit from attending this session by learning how different sociocultural factors cum economic and legal processes limit the full benefits of equality in decent works. Five speakers with different statistical research will share how women have been disadvantaged from decent work in all its different manifestations with copious policy implication recommendations.  Organiser:Prof. Femi Barnabas Adebola  Chair:Prof. Femi Barnabas Adebola  Speaker:Oluwadareolatunde OJO  Speaker:Oluwaseun Ayobami ADESINA  Speaker:Roseline Jumoke Kolawole  Speaker:Dr Olusegun Sunday Ewemooje  Discussant: Olukemi Grace ADEBOLA ",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/349/details/

The SDGs fit accurately with Africa’s priorities for the all-round development of the continent. The future of growth and its impact on poverty reduction among other goals in Africa hinges on what happens to structural transformation. The SDGs puts forward a broad agenda for global action on economic, social, and environmental development. The scales of the Sustainable Development Goals require innovation and modernization in the national statistical system in developing countries because twelve out of the seventeen goals are data-driven. To achieve the Goals by 2030, new modalities for development are required, including bringing innovation into the national statistics system of most African countries. This invited paper session highlights the level of Africa's economic, social and environmental development before 2015 and seven years after; presents various challenges most African countries are facing in achieving SDGs; highlights the roles timely official data play in the implementation of SDGs, and presents the way forward.

Statisticians can contribute with data and concepts to support policymakers’ actions and allow markets to react proactively and efficiently. Moreover, to monitor the transition to a low-carbon economy, it is important to identify the sources of funds used for this purpose and their impact in supporting this transition. However, so far there has been a lack of reliable and comparable indicators for tracking the growth in “green” financing across economies. Turning to physical and transition risk indicators, although they are increasingly in focus as expressed in various central bank publications, they often are not yet available. Important progress is however under way. For example, the new DGI envisages the collection and use of security-by-security data on green financial instruments, which will be key for assessing firms’ and banks’ exposures to climate risks. In parallel, and as an outcome of its monetary policy strategy review, the ECB will develop new experimental indicators covering green financial instruments. At the same time, the IFC Report on Sustainable finance data for Central Banks recommends leading by example by improving the usage of the new data being collected.   The session will discuss the important steps undertaken to start constructing needed indicators and applications today and design sustainable finance statistics accordingly. It will also review how leveraging on novel technologies enabled by AI and big data can further guide this process.   Organiser:Mr Bruno Tissot  Chair:Mr Robert Kirchner  Speaker:Ms Caroline Willeke  Speaker: Ms Magalena Erdem  Speaker:Maurice Fehr  Speaker:Jens Mehrhoff  Speaker: Hendrik Christian Doll ",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/434/details/

The session consists of four speakers, and cover the topics of missing data, model mis-specification, measurement error, and irregular observation times, all in the context of estimation of adaptive treatment strategies using techniques drawing on the causal inference literature.  Speakers The speakers in this session represent a diverse group of outstanding researchers. All speakers are presently employed at Canadian universities, however they represent three different maternal languages (English, French, and Finnish), three different countries of origin (Canada, England, and Finland), different sexual orientations (two members of the LGBTQ+ community), different genders (one woman), and different career stages: from very early career (PhD 2021) to a full professor. The session is organized and chaired by a senior female researcher. Dr. Janie Coulombe is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the Université de Montréal. She has graduated with a PhD in Biostatistics from McGill University (2021). Her research focuses on causal inference under irregular observation times and on the special features of observational data. After graduating with her PhD, Dr. Coulombe pursued a postdoctoral fellowship at McGill University working in collaboration with Dr. Erica Moodie (McGill University) and Dr. Susan Shortreed (University of Washington, Kaiser Permanente Washington). In 2022, she took up the position of Assistant Professor at the Université de Montréal. Dr. Denis Talbot is a Professor of Biostatistics at the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine of Laval University’s School of Medicine and a regular investigator at the University Health Centre of the Québec – Laval University Research Center. He holds a research career award from the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé. His research interests concern various topics in causal inference including model selection and personalized medicine. Dr. Michael Wallace is an Associate Professor at the University of Waterloo. Their research focuses on precision medicine and dynamic treatment regimes, developing new methodology to identify treatment decision rules based on patient-level data. More broadly, they study the effects of assumption violations in causal inference problems, with a particular focus on measurement error. Dr. Olli Saarela is an Associate Professor at Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto. Before joining U of T, he completed his PhD at University of Helsinki, Finland, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at McGill University. He is a biostatistician with methodological research interests in causal inference, Bayesian inference and survival analysis.  Organizer Dr. EricaMoodie is a Professor of Biostatistics and a Canada Research Chair (Tier 1) in Statistical Methods for Precision Medicine. She obtained her MPhil in Epidemiology in 2001 from the University of Cambridge and a PhD in Biostatistics in 2006 from the University of Washington, before joining the faculty at McGill. Her main research interests are in causal inference and longitudinal data with a focus on precision medicine. She is the 2020 recipient of the CRM-SSC Prize in Statistics and an Elected Member of the International Statistical Institute. Dr Moodie serves as an Associate Editor of Biometrics and a Statistical Editor of Journal of Infectious Diseases. She holds a chercheur de merite career award from the Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Sante. Tentative talk titles  Janie Coulombe - An individualized treatment rule for the choice of antidepressant drug with multiply imputed longitudinal data Denis Talbot - Double robust estimation of partially adaptive treatment strategies for hormonal therapy treatments for breast cancer Michael Wallace - Precision medicine with imprecise measurements: Exploring measurement error in dynamic treatment regimes Olli Saarela - Model-based estimation of multistage dynamic treatment regimes based on irregularly observed data   Causal inference attempts to uncover the structure of the data and eliminate all non-causative explanations for an observed association. The goal of most, if not all, statistical inference is to uncover causal relationships, but it is not in general possible to conclude causality from standard statistical inference procedures, merely that the observed association between two variables is not due to chance. The need for causal inference procedures is apparent in many fields, but is perhaps most pressing in the field of health research, where quantifying the efficacy of new therapies, or uncovering the etiology of diseases, is often rendered complicated due to difficulties inherent in observational studies. Even in experimental studies, partial compliance to treatment regimens can compromise a well-designed experiment. The complexity of models, and corresponding inference procedures, is heightened in the context of longitudinal studies, where time-dependent confounding may be present. The statistical study of adaptive treatment strategies, also called dynamic treatment regimes, is an area that has grown to prominence over the last two decades. While sequentially randomized trials can provide high quality evidence for the efficacy of tailored sequences of treatments, the sample sizes needed to estimate heterogeneous effects that form the basis of treatment personalization are such that non-experimental data sources are commonly used to estimate adaptive treatment strategies. Thus, methods in causal inference have formed the basis for most estimation approaches in this area.  The aim of this proposed session is to showcase the application and development of statistical methods that address challenges and biases in observational data to help solve problems relating to personalization of care. The session would consist of four speakers, and cover the topics of missing data, model mis-specification, measurement error, and irregular observation times.

However, traditional data sources used to produce official statistics face several limitations when used to provide information for disaggregated population groups. To address the challenge of “leave no one behind”, required for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, NSOs have to address several issues to adopt innovative methods of data integration that combine information from different data sources (household surveys, population censuses, administrative records, satellite imagery, and social media) to produce not only geographically disaggregated official statistics, but also information for vulnerable populations allocated all along the countries. The growing need for disaggregated and timely statistics for specific geographic areas and small groups of the population can be adequately fulfilled by innovative procedures such as small area estimation and record linkage; and by using surveys and nontraditional data such as remote sensing and mobile phone positioning data, which allows for achieving accuracy beyond the limits of the survey sample approach. Many countries have begun to use these techniques to provide official statistics of poverty, unemployment, crime, and victimization, among others. In this context, the World Bank, the UN Regional Commissions, and the Inter-Secretariat Working Group on Household Surveys have been collaborating on capacity-building projects to support countries in producing more disaggregated data for SDG monitoring. The session will bring speakers from national statistical offices, academia, regional and international organizations together to: - Share experiences of NSOs in adopting a culture of data integration for a broad range of indicators; and discuss challenges in countries - Discuss the need for more research on data integration methods to support low- and middle-income countries, when data access, data availability and technical capacity are often lacking - Review challenges in building capacities of NSOs in small area estimation and other types of data integration and how different communities can collaborate to support countries   National Statistical Offices (NSOs) have the mandate to collect, analyze and disseminate official statistics for monitoring the development of socio-economic indicators that help policy makers to make better decisions.

Our ability to measure ecosystem services has greatly improved with advances in remote sensing and modelling, but also benefits from integrating data from a variety of sources, including the environment, society, and the economy. Urban areas provide unique measurement challenges, due to their heterogeneity, rapid changes, and the many human factors to consider (including data confidentiality). But they also offer opportunities, in terms of availability of data (dense population centres are often high priority areas for data collection on a range of topics), and the impact on so many residents. We hope this session will be of interest to environmental statisticians, as well as practitioners in other fields interested in integrating environmental statistics in their work. We also see this as an opportunity to share experiences with organizing and integrating large data sets from a variety of sources to compile statistics on a national scale.   Most people in the world today live in cities, with the proportion expected to continue to increase.  Urban environments have profound impacts on residents’ health and well-being, in terms of air quality, water quality, temperature regulation, and other “ecosystem services” (nature’s contributions to people).  This session will explore methods, approaches, and applications of measuring ecosystem services that contribute to human well-being in urban environments.   Organiser: Dr Jonathan Whiteley  Chair: Dr Jessica Andrews  Speaker: Dr Jonathan Whiteley   Speaker: Lauren Allen Speaker: Marie-Janick Speaker: Dr Amanda Schwantes",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/436/details/

Among the different quality principles, timeliness, coherence and relevance assume a higher importance than in the past and meed to be assessed accordingly. Appropriate measures should also take into account the possible benefical effects on lower response burden on respondents as well as a possible reduction in costs. First preliminary approaches tend to ensure the use of sound methodology, anyway this is one of the most critical aspects to assess, together with measures devoted to accuracy.

The amount and quality of information extracted from data is often driven by how data were collected and analyzed according to the type of experiments. Thus, design and analysis of experiments for data science is a key to achieve analysis efficiency and computation efficiency. The purpose of this invited session is to bring five statistics experts working in this area to showcase how experimental design and analysis plays an important role in Data Science. We have a special issue on “Design and Analysis of Experiments for Data Science” at the New England Journal of Statistics in Data Science (NEJSDS). Detailed information can be found at https://journal.nestat.org/news/Design_and_Analysis.  These four speakers are selected from those who have agreed to submit their work to this special issue. The discussant is one of the co-editors for this special issue. The five participants are Drs. John Stufken from George Mason University (USA), Luc Pronzato from Laboratoire I3S - Sophia Antipolis (France), C. Devon Lin from Queen’s University (Canada), Lulu Kang from Illinois Institute of Technology (USA), and Simon Mak from Duke University (USA). The five speakers also well represent a gender diversity: Drs. Lulu Kang and C. Devon Lin are female while the other three speakers are male.  Experimental design and analysis have wide generality and significant advantages for gaining attractive inferential and computational properties. For example, as extraordinary amounts of data are being produced in many branches of science, proven statistical methods are no longer applicable with extraordinary large datasets due to computational limitations. A critical step in big data analysis is data reduction, which is an experimental design problem. Many newly developed methodology in this field have important applications in data sciences. This session aims to cover some representative work on relevant practical problems., such as multi-stage multi-fidelity Gaussian process model for computer experiments, subdata selection for data reduction in data science, variational inference for computation efficiency in data science, optimal designs for nonlinear model in data science.       We hope this session will help facilitate cross-fertilization of experimental design and analysis and data science.

Some novel technologies that have emerged recently at the intersection between the fields of cryptography, distributed systems and computer science, are instrumental to achieve this goal. The family of so-called Privacy Enhancing Technologies (e.g. Secure Multiparty Computation, Homomorphic Encryption and Trusted Execution Environment)  open new possibilities in terms of how “data” and “computation” are handled and controlled within and across organisations. With these technologies, governance policies can be enforced technologically without necessarily relying on a single point of trust. These technologies have reached maturity and are already moving from laboratories to real-world applications. An increasing number of statistical institutions have started to pioneer possible applications of these technologies in explorative or pilot projects around different use-cases. The goal of this session is to provide a stage for such pioneering activities, share early experiences and lessons learned, discuss what we can (or can not) expect from these technologies and exchange views as to how the adoption of these technologies impacts (or is impacted by) organisational aspects, business processes and legislation. The session will consist of 4 speakers reporting on experimental and pilot projects leveraging PET for statistics, including one speaker from the UN PET Lab.

                 Dr Xiaoqiong Joan Hu","Access to administrative health databases provides immense opportunity to study longitudinal patient health outcomes, drug usage, and disease surveillance, among others. These databases are becoming more complex due to the increasing volume of patients and their encounters with the healthcare system, the integration of imaging and genetic data, and different coding standards in different systems. Most databases were not built for research purposes, and due to the complex nature of the data, proper statistical methods are needed to answer specific research questions.  In this session, we invited five speakers from various career stages with a strong record of research in methods for complex data obtained from administrative health data. Professor Joan Hu from the Department of Statistics at Simon Fraser University will present the analysis of zero-truncated recurrent events data applied to mental health related emergency department visits. Dr. Eleanor Pullenayegum, Senior Scientist at SickKids Research Institute, will present approaches to handling the informative visit process observed in electronic health records of newborns. Assistant Professor Kuan Liu from the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation at the University of Toronto will present Bayesian sensitivity analysis that models time-dependent unmeasured confounders applied to multi-centre pediatric disease registry. Assistant Professor Zihang Lu from the Department of Public Health Sciences at Queens University will present a joint modeling approach for clustering multiple longitudinal traits using administrative data with complex structures. Assistant Professor Aya Mitani from the Division of Biostatistics at the University of Toronto will present a multistate modeling approach for clustered interval censored data obtained from an administrative oral health database. Professor Wendy Lou from the University of Toronto will chair the session.  The purpose of the session is three-fold: to bring together researchers with recent works on analyzing complex administrative health data to present their methodological advances and applications; to provide an opportunity to bridge gaps and foster collaborations within the ISI community who work with administrative databases; and to give a larger audience access to these developments and applications by promoting interaction and networking among researchers and trainees.  JH: There has been increasing interest in utilizing administrative health data to achieve various scientific goals. Truncation issues arising from analysis of administrative health records are particularly challenging. We present our recent projects on tackling a zero-truncation issue by integrating zero-truncated recurrent events data with available population-based demographic information. We employ the mental health related emergency department visits generated from an administrative cohort to motivate and illustrate the statistical analysis under loosely structured models. This presentation is based on joint work with Angela Chen (Simon Fraser University), Rhonda Rosychuk (University of Alberta), and Yi Xiong (University of Manitoba). EP: Longitudinal data collected as part of usual healthcare delivery are becoming increasingly available for research through electronic health records. However, a common feature of these data is that they are collected more frequently when patients are unwell. For example, newborns who are slow to regain their birthweight will require more frequent monitoring and will consequently have more weight measurements than their typically growing counterparts. Failing to account for this would lead to underestimation of the rate of growth of the population of newborns as a whole. I will discuss approaches to handling the informative nature of the observation, including recent developments to handle other data complexities such as clustering, causal inference, and variable selection.  KL: Although administrative data are rich in information, key confounders might not be captured. Several Bayesian sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounding have been developed that use bias parameters to capture the effect of unobserved confounders. However, these methods do not consider time-dependent unmeasured confounders. We will develop a parametric Bayesian sensitivity analysis that models time-dependent unmeasured confounders. We will formally define sequential ignorability assumption given the unobserved confounders and discuss identifiability of our model. We will apply our approach to study the effectiveness of oral vancomycin for pediatric primary sclerosing cholangitis using a multi-centre pediatric disease registry.  ZL: Identifying disease phenotypes based on longitudinal traits is a common goal in biomedical study. Compared to clustering a single longitudinal trait, integrating multiple longitudinal traits allows additional information to be incorporated into the clustering process, which reveals co-existing longitudinal patterns and generates deeper biological insight. This talk will discuss a joint modeling approach for clustering multiple longitudinal traits using administrative data with complex structures. Results from analyzing real and simulated data will be presented and discussed.  AM: Patients with periodontitis visit dental clinics routinely and multiple markers on each tooth are recorded at each visit. To characterize the progression of periodontal markers on each tooth, we extend the multistate model framework to account for informative cluster size by incorporating the within-cluster resampling method and cluster-weighted score function, from which we can obtain the marginal inference about the association of time to disease progression with subject-level covariates. We assess the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies and apply them to the longitudinal data obtained from the Canadian Armed Forces Oral Health Database.   JH: There has been increasing interest in utilizing administrative health data to achieve various scientific goals.

Several Bayesian sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounding have been developed that use bias parameters to capture the effect of unobserved confounders. However, these methods do not consider time-dependent unmeasured confounders. We will develop a parametric Bayesian sensitivity analysis that models time-dependent unmeasured confounders. We will formally define sequential ignorability assumption given the unobserved confounders and discuss identifiability of our model. We will apply our approach to study the effectiveness of oral vancomycin for pediatric primary sclerosing cholangitis using a multi-centre pediatric disease registry.  ZL: Identifying disease phenotypes based on longitudinal traits is a common goal in biomedical study. Compared to clustering a single longitudinal trait, integrating multiple longitudinal traits allows additional information to be incorporated into the clustering process, which reveals co-existing longitudinal patterns and generates deeper biological insight. This talk will discuss a joint modeling approach for clustering multiple longitudinal traits using administrative data with complex structures. Results from analyzing real and simulated data will be presented and discussed.  AM: Patients with periodontitis visit dental clinics routinely and multiple markers on each tooth are recorded at each visit. To characterize the progression of periodontal markers on each tooth, we extend the multistate model framework to account for informative cluster size by incorporating the within-cluster resampling method and cluster-weighted score function, from which we can obtain the marginal inference about the association of time to disease progression with subject-level covariates. We assess the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies and apply them to the longitudinal data obtained from the Canadian Armed Forces Oral Health Database.

                 Ms Aberash Tariku Abaye ","In early 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic began spreading, many National Statistics Institutes (NSIs) worked with local governments and national heath authorities to temporarily revise or suspend data collection operation. In numerous cases, all in-person data collection was suspended, and NSIs pivoted to gathering survey information via the web, mail, or telephone. As nations emerge from the pandemic, how NSIs collect data may not be the same post-pandemic as it was pre-pandemic. Should some, or all, of the data collection adjustments made during the pandemic be retained? Assessing the effect of using different and, perhaps, more mixed modes is critical to answering this question. In many cases, to meet the demands for current information, new procedures were implemented without being fully tested, giving rise to questions about the quality of the resulting estimates. In this session, speakers working in diverse areas of official statistics will discuss the strategies being used to determine how the innovative data collection methods developed during the pandemic will affect post-pandemic approaches to data collection. The potential differences in pre- and post-pandemic methods as well as the approaches to monitoring changing conditions will be explored as each speaker focuses on how best to produce accurate, reliable statistics in the post-pandemic era. Gero Carletto, World Bank, will discuss the high-frequency telephone surveys that were implemented when the pandemic forced a shift from face-to-face interviews and the impact this effort has had and will have on post-pandemic data collection. Aberash Tariku, Ethiopian Statistics Service, will review the transition from fully face-to-face data collection to electronic data collection and transfer, the implementation of virtual training for field staff, and the improved processes that will continue during the pot-pandemic era. Leonne Hollanders, Statistics Netherlands, will highlight how the collaborative efforts between Statistics Netherlands and Statistics Canada to develop a vision of Future Advanced Data Collection well before the pandemic helped Statistics Netherlands produce quick, relevant information during the pandemic and how those efforts will impact post-pandemic data collection. Barbara R.

Presentation - 1  ------------- · Presenter: Ashkan Ebadi, National Research Council of Canada · Presentation title: COVID-19 screening tools based on medical images using few-shot learning strategies · Summary: Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on the global healthcare systems, and there has not been a region or domain that has not felt its impact in one way or another. The gold standard of COVID-19 screening is the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. With RT-PCR being laborious and time-consuming, much work has gone into exploring other possible screening tools to observe abnormalities in medical images using deep neural network architectures. But, such deep neural network-based solutions require a large amount of labelled data for training. In this talk, we will first briefly introduce the few-shot learning approach in which models are built such that they can adapt to novel tasks based on small numbers of training examples. Next, we will see its application in a real-life example where we used few-shot learning strategies to build an open-source explainable model sensitive to COVID-19 positive cases, using a very limited set of annotated data. The model can generalize from a few examples by employing a unique structure to rank similarities between inputs without necessitating extensive retraining. The developed technology is low-cost and non-invasive and can adapt to new pandemics and diseases. · Collaborators o Dr. Alexander Wong – University of Waterloo o Dr. Adrian Florea – McGill University o Dr. Sonny Kohli – McMaster University o Stéphane Tremblay and Dr. Pengcheng Xi – National Research Council of Canada o And, multinational companies such as Microsoft and Redhat.   Presentation 2 ---------------  · Presenter: James Ooi, National Research Council of Canada · Presentation title: COVID-19 in-host modelling: applying mechanistic models to understand the vaccine-induced immune response. · Summary At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, several vaccine candidates (adenovirus vector, mRNA and protein subunit vaccine) approvals were accelerated for emergency use. The approval was guided by limited clinical trial data performed within a short study time frame. Due to these unprecedented data challenges, there exist gaps in understanding various aspects of these vaccines, including but not limited to host immunogenicity beyond the study time frame, varying doses, age, sex and effects of adjuvants. By applying limited published clinical trial data, we developed within-host mathematical models for various vaccine types that are currently in use or in the final stages of clinical trials in Canada and analyse its associated humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses. The vaccine-induced immune response investigated includes the antibodies, T helper cells, cytokines and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The models’ prediction allows for a better understanding of the relationship between immune cells and cytokines while parameter sensitivity analysis establishes the factors that contribute to peak immune response of different vaccine types. The long-term antibody prediction shows a discernible degradation. This finding supports the current third-dose booster guidelines. Our within-host models guide the vaccination strategy by health authorities to optimize the vaccine rollout and serve as an in-silico tool for future vaccine re-formulation.  · Collaborators: o Prof. Jane Heffernan - York University o Dr. Mohammad Sajjad Ghaemi - NRC-Fields Collaboration Centre o Prof. Mario Ostrowski - University of Toronto o Prof. James Watmough - University of New Brunswick o Prof. Morgan Craig - University of Montreal.  Presentation - 3 -------------------- · Presenter: Miroslava Čuperlović-Culf, National Research Council of Canada · Presentation title: Machine learning modeling of the effect of COVID19 on metabolic network. · Summary Models of metabo-lipidomics network obtained from high throughput omics measurements and developed using hybrid data and knowledge based approaches show alteration in the metabolic steady state in severe cases of COVID19. Sex and age effects on this change are explored using Gaussian Process Regression, a Machine learning approach as well as distance correlation, statistical method and related to possible long term effects of COVID19. These novel approaches, augmented with univariate analysis of changes in lipidome and metabolome, provide information about functional systemic changes that identify potential biomarkers, novel therapeutic targets for more effective anti-viral treatments or adjuvant targets to augment vaccination strategies. · Collaborators: o Dr. Miroslava Čuperlović-Culf - National Research Council of Canada o Dr. Irina Alecu - University of Ottawa o Anuradha Surendra - National Research Council of Canada o Thao Nguyen-Tran - University of Ottawa o Dr. Angela M.

In this session, we propose to have four speakers at various stages of their career, who are working on the cutting edge of different methodological advances in this research area.  These are, along with tentative talk titles: Patrick Brown (University of Toronto) – Statistical issues in estimating seroprevalence Cindy Feng (Dalhousie University) – Spatial-temporal modelling of COVID-19 mortality risk in Toronto, Canada Raja Ben Hajria (University of Calgary) – Individual-level hidden Markov models of epidemics Harlan Campbell (University of British Columbia) – Inferring the COVID-19 infection fatality rate in the community-dwelling population via Bayesian evidence synthesis As we have seen from the COVID-19 pandemic, data on an Emerging Infectious Disease (EID) epidemic available during a pandemic is bound to be incomplete and biased. The proportion of infected individuals who are tested varies over time, geographically and by ethnic group, and by age and sex. Obtaining an accurate picture of the extent of an EID in the population, and the various sub-populations which are most severely affected, requires complex modelling of existing data sources and innovative data collection strategies. Even with the highest-quality and most representative data available the need to account for incompleteness and bias in the data and uncertainty in the eventual results is central to any analysis. Advanced biostatistical methods, both existing and as of yet undeveloped, will be an essential component of our toolbox for managing future EID’s and for understanding the COVID-19 pandemic itself.
 
This session assembles four of Canada’s top Biostatistical researchers with expertise and experience in methods for infectious disease epidemiology working in a variety of areas including: individual-level modelling of epidemics; seroprevalence studies; disease mapping and spatial statistics; using Bayesian evidence synthesis to estimate infection fatality rates from biased data.

As such, statistical learning models have become an integral tool for investigating key scientific and industrial questions. There are, however, fundamental limitations. Existing models are often black-box and lack scientific interpretability. High-quality scientific data can also be expensive, resulting in small sample sizes for model training, and thus poor predictive models with high uncertainty. This session focuses on novel developments in science-integrated statistical learning theory and methods, which tackle these issues by integrating scientific domain knowledge (e.g., mechanistic models, differential equations, guiding principles) as prior information for statistical model building.

On the one hand, there are initiatives like the Open Data movement and FAIR publishing that aim to improve the transparency of the analysis, metadata, and data used by researchers as well as the accessibility of the results for users. On the other hand in nowadays almost standard online publishing practice, the advanced use of hyperlinks to the data sets used, (dynamic) graphs and tables from other sources, and the fast-growing variety of IT tools that allow comparing results from similar studies, create opportunities for users to a more thorough assessment of the quality of the data and analysis as well as the added value of the specific analysis. Both developments are expected to ease the access and understanding of official statistics analysis and consequently impact statistical literacy. In the session, both developments will be discussed, from the perspective of producers of official statistics as well as from the academic users’ perspective. The audience for this session is expected to observe how these developments in the coming years will affect publishing in official statistics with a special focus on journals like the Statistical Journal of the IAOS. The session is of special interest for the future strategy and development of the Statistical Journal of the IAOS, as well as other science publishing activities of the statistics community.

Alejandra Arias Salazar: Small area estimation of poverty incidence in Costa Rica under a Structure Preserving Estimation (SPREE) approach. 
 
Obtaining reliable estimates in small areas is a challenge because of the coverage and periodicity of data collection. Several techniques of small area estimation have been proposed to produce quality measures in small areas, but few of them are focused on updating these estimates. By combining the attributes of the most recent versions of the structure-preserving estimation methods, this paper proposes a new alternative to estimate and update cross-classified counts for small domains, when the variable of interest is not available in the census. The proposed methodology is used to obtain and update
estimates of the incidence of poverty in 81 Costa Rican cantons for six
postcensal years (2012 - 2017). As uncertainty measures, mean squared errors are estimated via parametric bootstrap, and the adequacy of the proposed method is assessed with a design-based simulation. Ziqing Dong: Linearization and variance estimation of the Bonferroni inequality index. The study of income inequality is important for predicting the wealth of a country. There is an increasing number of publications where the authors call for the use of several indices simultaneously to better account for the wealth distribution. Due to the fact that income data are usually collected through sample surveys, the sampling properties
of income inequality measures should not be overlooked. The most widely used inequality measure is the Gini index, and its inferential aspects have been deeply investigated.  An alternative inequality index could be the Bonferroni inequality index, although less attention on its inference has been paid in the literature. The aim of this paper is to address the inference of the Bonferroni index in a finite population
framework. The Bonferroni index is linearized by differentiation with respect to the sample indicators which allows for conducting a valid inference. Furthermore, the linearized variables are used to evaluate the effects of the different observations on the Bonferroni and Gini indices.
The result demonstrates once for all that the former is more sensitive to the lowest incomes in the distribution than the latter. Organiser:PROF. DR. Nikolaos Tzavidis  Chair:PROF. DR.

 20 July 2023,Thursday,10:00,12:00,IPS 164 - Validating the Independence and Integrity of Statistics around the World,IPS Room 214,Category: IPS,,,"Promoting the Independence and Integrity of Statistics around the World Confronted with serious questions the societies of our time need worthy information to inform related decisions. To overcome crises, to achieve global agendas as the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris climate objectives, statistical evidence must be fit for purpose. The prerequisite for this is an efficient as well as ethically sound use of the ever growing and diversified data sources and the application of methods of data science. For statistics to fulfil their goal of serving the common good and providing a language in public discourse through which conflicting issues can be objectified, they must be trustworthy, of high quality and contain value for the issues at hand. For this to succeed, a data culture is needed in which value creation by the statistics producers and appreciation by their users mutually reinforce each other in a positive way. This is where the ISI Ethical Declaration and the UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics come in: They offer guidance on the responsible, professional conduct of individual statisticians and on the principles of good governance of statistical institutions by governments. Of course, this only addresses one side of the data culture, namely that of the producers. For statisticians to be able to do their work along professionally recognised best practices and without undue (political) interference, the (political) framework conditions must be right. Independence and integrity are the leitmotifs that mark the critical conditions for this. The question of how the independence and integrity of statistics can be guaranteed is one with rising attention by many actors in society and should benefit from a proper political weight. In a situation where 'alternative facts' tend to be considered by many as equal to solid and professional statistical facts, we can witness that the door is wide open for manipulation of any kind. When asking about the needs and possibilities to improve the current situation in different regions and countries, it seems advisable to take a comprehensive approach starting from the producer side (promotion of statistical ethics and governance; improvement of statistical education in this respect) as well as from the political framework conditions (collecting sound evidence on integrity; monitoring the political situation; representing and protecting the interests of statisticians and statistical institutions). The session will follow on from the discussion in ISI WSC 2021 (IPS 53) and address the question of how to organise quantification and monitoring of statistical independence and integrity from a global perspective. Ways and means to promote knowledge of professional ethics will be discussed, not least with a focus on countries of the Global South and on improving statistical education. In this debate, both representatives of institutional statistics and of the statistical associations and academia should contribute to provide a wide range of inputs. It will have to be discussed how complementarity can be achieved, using the possibilities (and respecting the limitations) of international official statistics on the one hand, and those of NGOs to protect and advocate for good statistics on the other.   Organiser:PROF.

Some countries in the region have adapted the model of the Nordic countries to the local context. They have built statistical population registers from the integration of several administrative sources that have been consolidated as the basis for future register-based censuses. In this session of invited papers, these experiences in the region will be presented and their sustainability and use in population censuses will be discussed.   In recent years, the NSOs in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) have been advancing steadily towards the construction of national statistical systems based on integrated statistical registers systems (from administrative sources).  Some countries in LAC have adapted the Nordic countries’ model to build statistical population registers from the integration of several administrative sources that have been consolidated as the basis for future register-based censuses.  Several difficulties have been found on this journey: outdated legal frameworks; lack of national population register with address of residence (updated); poor quality migration registers; different reference time among administrative registers; different concepts, definitions; variables and units between administrative and statistical registers. But the big challenge is accessing to administrative data in a sustainable way.
Despite these problems, some LAC countries have made steady progress in using administrative registers for statistical purposes based on some strengths: strong National Statistical System; good reputation and image of the NSO; widely used personal id numbers; good coverage and quality of administrative registers (in several cases). Four countries of LAC (Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and Uruguay) have built or are building population registers and other statistical registers using personal identification numbers to link records from different data sources.
They have already started to produce statistics from administrative registers on a regular basis, like labour market statistics based on integration of several administrative data sources (registers of beneficiaries of social programs, health, education, social security contributors, business registers from social security and tax authorities). Furthermore, these countries are taking advantage of the traditional population censuses that will be carried out between 2022 and 2023 to pilot register-based censuses and compare the results with the traditional census taking the same reference time. 
In this invited paper session, these experiences in the region will be presented and their sustainability and use in population censuses will be discussed. Also, we will try to answer the main question “is an official statistics system based on administrative registers in LAC an achievable dream?” This session seeks to inspire other NSOs from LAC and other regions to continue in this direction, despite the difficulties and differences with the Nordic and other countries that have already advanced on this way.

                 Igor Chernyshev","Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and tertiary education systems are known to be under pressure to deliver graduates meeting the labour market demand. The performance of these systems is commonly judged by the: a) scale of shortages of skilled labour reported by employers, and b) surpluses of graduates, some of whom may be unemployed or employed in low-skilled or different occupations leading to occupational and qualification mismatches. Imbalances between the supply and demand for skilled labour may arise for various reasons. For example, because the increasing education level of the population is outperforming the growth of skilled jobs in the economy or the TVET graduates are not absorbed by industries. Also, trained persons may move abroad, etc.  Due to the lack of relevant labour market information (LMI) on shortages and surpluses of skilled labour or lack of expertise in how to use it, TVET systems commonly operate as (i) those “student demand driven” or (ii) whose training programs’ delivery is determined by the availability of resources, instructors, and equipment. In particular, the availability of LMI and its use in programming of professional education help reduce risks of shortages and surpluses of skilled labour in the regional markets. Most countries conduct a Labour Force Survey (LFS) collecting quarterly data on employment, unemployment and other characteristics of the population. An LFS collects, inter alia, data on the occupational structure of the labour force. The ISCO-08 levels 3 and 4 are the levels of detail required for a comprehensive analysis of the labour force by individual occupations. Importantly, these two levels are used as LMI-based guidance for planning TVET delivery. For TVET delivery planning a concept of «additional” demand for skilled labour is largely used. It is based on estimates of skilled labour by occupation and produced annually following regional employment trends. It should however be noted that, generally, the national labour market-oriented statistical surveys (an LFS, a Labour Turnover Survey, etc.) do not aim to advise TVET and tertiary education systems directly. Because of that, while countries have such powerful statistical tools as an LFS, the National Statistical Organisations (NSOs) do not usually provide the Ministries of Education and Ministries of Labour with data on persons employed by industry and occupation at ISCO-08 levels 3 and 4 (minor and unit groups) and do not produce estimates of replacement demand. This leads to the situation when national TVET and Higher Education authorities lack a comprehensive LMI containing data on shortages and surpluses of skilled labour, which hampers making operational evidence-based decisions about training programmes, balancing the delivery of TVET graduates and planning optimal skilled labour replacement.  This ISP Session will present an innovative method developed by the team of international experts working on the ILO and UNDP projects in Armenia (Unleashing Employment and Income Generating Opportunities for the Youth in the Regions of Armenia) and the Philippines (Skills for Prosperity: Output 3. Strengthening TVET and LMIS, data collection and analysis), which has made it possible to modify and enhance the LFS tools of these two countries to produce (i) additional labour market information needed for TVET delivery planning; (ii) employment occupational structure at ISCO-08 levels 3 and 4 enabling to anticipate skills demand by occupation; (iii) measuring the additional demand for skilled labour; as well as (iv) extend the use of occupations of unemployed persons with previous employment experience to estimate skilled labour supply along with data on TVET graduates.   Abstract TVET and tertiary education systems are known to be under pressure to deliver graduates meeting the labour market demand.  The performance of these systems is commonly judged by the: a) scale of shortages of skilled labour reported by employers, and b) surpluses of graduates, some of whom may be unemployed or employed in low-skilled or different occupations leading to occupational and qualification mismatches. Imbalances between the supply and demand for skilled labour may arise for various reasons. For example, because the increasing education level of the population is outperforming the growth of skilled jobs in the economy or the TVET graduates are not absorbed by industries. Also, trained persons may move abroad, etc. Likewise, an imbalance in the occupational structure of the labour market could arise because TVET and the tertiary systems may continue producing graduates in occupations that give them little or no chance of finding a job as the local labour market may already be saturated with persons having similar occupational profiles. Due to the lack of relevant labour market information (LMI) on shortages and surpluses of skilled labour or lack of expertise in how to use it, TVET systems commonly operate as (i) those “student demand driven” or (ii) whose training programs’ delivery is determined by the availability of resources, instructors, and equipment. In particular, the availability of LMI and its use in programming of professional education help reduce risks of shortages and surpluses of skilled labour in the regional markets. Most countries conduct a Labour Force Survey (LFS) collecting quarterly data on employment, unemployment, and other population characteristics. An LFS collects data on the occupational structure of the labour force. The ISCO-08 levels 3 and 4 are the levels of detail required for a comprehensive analysis of labour force by individual occupations. Importantly, these two levels are used as LMI-based guidance for planning TVET delivery. For TVET delivery planning a concept of «additional” demand for skilled labour is largely used. It is based on estimates of skilled labour by occupation and produced annually following regional employment trends. The «additional” demand refers to the labour force required to: Ensure annual expansion of industry employment («Expansion demand»). Replace skilled workers separating from their jobs because (a) quitting the labour force, and (b) changing occupation while changing jobs («Replacement demand») Both streams of demand commonly exist in any economy - even if there is no industrial employment expansion, the replacement demand would always exist simply due to labour turnover. It should however be noted that, generally, the national labour market-oriented statistical surveys (an LFS, a Labour Turnover Survey, etc.) do not aim to advise TVET and tertiary education systems directly. Therefore, the professional education systems must identify, interpret and use additional LMI containing estimates of anticipated annual demand for skilled labour and detailed occupational structure of the labour force. Because of the above, while countries have such powerful statistical tools as LFS, the National Statistical Organisations (NSOs) do not usually provide the Ministries of Education and Ministries of Labour with data on persons employed by industry and occupation at ISCO-08 levels 3 and 4 (minor and unit groups) and do not produce estimates of replacement demand. This leads to the situation when national TVET and Higher Education authorities lack a comprehensive LMI containing data on shortages and surpluses of skilled labour, which hampers making operational evidence-based decisions about training programmes, balancing the delivery of TVET graduates, and planning optimal skilled labour replacement.

                 Mr Matthew Welch ; Dr Lara Cleveland ","Given the persistent huge data gaps for policy development and enhancing research as well as improving the availability of timely data for measuring the SDG indicators will not only require significant investment in new or improved data collection instruments and data sources, but also making the data already collected by governments, the private sector and the civil society openly available to all users (decision-makers as well as the public at large) in a format which is easily re-usable and machine-readable. It is often the case that basic data that could be used for policy development and compile SDG indicators are available in national statistical agencies and international organization, research institutes and the private sector, but with limited or no access for the wider use . In such cases, promoting and enhancing access to machine-readable data would allow international organizations, research Institutions, academia and advocacy groups to make use of this data and add value by transforming them into policy analysis and global public goods that can significantly improve the design, formulation, monitoring and evaluation of evidenced-based policies and investment decisions. The adoption of dissemination policies embracing open data principles and promoting access to non-confidential microdata will therefore ultimately increase the transparency and accountability of national development policies and facilitate the achievement of improved development outcomes, including of the SDG goals and targets. Disseminating microdata adds transparency, derives additional business value, and promotes open data values. In the spirit of reproducible research, it is now common practice for some international organizations (IOs) to disseminate micro datasets used to generate results of major publications. This session, therefore, is designed to share experiences from the international organization on their effort to unlock microdata related to their mandate. In general, the experiences is expected to provide the audiences the motivation for these international organizations to move towards availing microdata, the technology and procedures put in place to provide access to microdata, the internal policy they put in place to realize disseminating microdata, the approaches followed to promote the use of microdata disseminated, the main challenges encountered and future plans. We expect that other international organizations and national statistical offices, research institutes and the private sector dealing in generating data will benefit from this session in opening up access to their microdata to improve better use and justify the return for investment in conducting surveys and censuses.   Keywords: microdata, metadata standards, confidentiality, data anonymization   Organiser:Mr Yakob Seid  Chair:Pietro Gennari  Speaker:Matthew John Welch  Speaker:Yakob Seid  Speaker:Dr Lara Cleveland  Discussant: Ms Haoyi Chen ",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/348/details/

                 Eric Sigaud ","In 2001 the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) published its first version of the DDI standard. Developed by an international group of metadata professionals from archives, research organizations, and statistical agencies, the DDI sought to provide a format of structured documentation that would facilitate, access, distribution, preservation, and the intelligent use of data produced by surveys and other observational methods in the social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences. Initially focused on description, the standard has expanded to encompass metadata reuse within and between organizations, and support metadata driven systems from concept to analysis. Over the years DDI has expanded from a single product, the descriptive DDI Codebook, to a suite of products focused on the needs of several communities. DDI Lifecycle, a significant expansion of DDI Codebook that includes metadata reuse, addresses the needs of data producing organizations, such as national statistical offices. Recent additions include XKOS, an RDF vocabulary to manage and publish Statistical Classifications, SDTL to capture data processing steps in a non-proprietary language that can be used within DDI products and other systems, and Cross Domain Integration (CDI) which focuses on the metadata needed to programmatically integrate data for multiple domains.   This panel presents on the applied use of various DDI products by Statistical Agencies to support a range of activities from capturing the descriptive metadata needed to support the accurate use and sharing of survey and census data, manage conceptual content for consistency and quality, and the development and fielding of questionnaires. Discussion will center on issues arising during the applied use of DDI products in different situations, and the development of DDI as driven by the current and potential user community. 
Topics to be discussed include:
- Introduction to the DDI Suite of products focusing on the high-level coverage model and applications for the various products, including current work on improved translation of content between products and new implementation languages;
- Use of DDI Codebook at the World Bank, internally and in its technical assistance program, and development of DDI-based tools for improved data discoverability, usability, and accessibility;
- DDI-powered production process at Insee that covers three quarters of Insee's surveys and produces around one million questionnaires each year, and testing the use of DDI for the automation of the survey process and for the ingestion of administrative data;
- DDI Lifecycle, and portions of the draft DDI CDI, use at the BLS to guide the development of metadata systems;
- Metadata-driven data gateway at Statistics Estonia to collect data from public data registers, from the description of data at the variable level to the description of data sets stored in databases, and from the description of the raw data to the description of the output data Cubes;
- Integrated metadata ecosystem at Statistics Canada spanning metadata capture, management and reuse across the statistical business process;   Organiser:Dr Flavio Rizzolo  Chair:Ms Wendy Thomas  Speaker:Olivier Dupriez  Speaker:Chantal Vaillancourt  Speaker:Eric Sigaud  Speaker:Dan Gillman  Speaker: Mrs Kaia Kulla",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/343/details/

Many feel that the solution to this conundrum is as easy as using alternative data. However, it is becoming clear that alternative data is not necessarily always the answer due to challenges such as conceptual differences, quality of the data, access to the data, etc.. This does not mean that alternative data should not be consider as they have a lot of upside in terms of being used as auxiliary data for modelling purposes. This session considers several ways that alternative data can be combined with more traditional data through models to produce official statistics with higher quality than the alternative or the traditional data themselves.

                 Prof. Eric Vance ","Statistics is a multifaceted discipline that presents challenges for its practitioners at many levels of application. The effective practice of statistics begins with a clear understanding of statistical principles and the role they play in quantifying uncertainty in answers to questions of subject matter importance. In today’s collaborative professional environments, however, additional capabilities are needed to enhance one’s effectiveness in integrating statistical insights into organizational settings. Skills such as clearly communicating ideas, actively building trust, and developing bridges among various disciplines can contribute to a statistician’s professional effectiveness. It is not easy, however, to identify a career path for acquiring the various skills needed to effectively present statistical ideas and integrate quantitative solutions into an organizational setting. A well-known approach to transferring knowledge and fostering collaborative skills useful for professional development of statisticians is the mentor/mentee relationship. Such a relationship is mutually beneficial. The mentor shares workplace knowledge and culture, suggests alternative technical approaches and contributes constructive feedback. The mentee explores novel technical challenges, adopts new professional goals and takes new career risks. In return, the mentor learns from a newly trained statistician and the mentee learns the intricacies of a new workplace culture. The mentor/mentee relationship also benefits an organization by fostering professional development in an environment where engaged and creative employees contribute to workplace productivity. However, mentoring is also multifaceted. It involves aspects of coaching, advising, consulting, collaborating, championing, teaching, and learning. What mentoring means to one person will almost surely be different for another person. What is undeniable is that mentoring can be a useful tool in building the capacity of an individual statistician and thereby building the capacity of the organization in which he or she works. This session will describe a new mentoring effort from the ISI’s Capacity Building Committee. It will feature three speakers and two discussants. Paper #1: Eric Vance from the University of Colorado Boulder, USA is the chair of a new Mentoring committee within ISI. He will describe ISI’s new mentoring programs and how it can build statistics capacity, especially in developing countries. Paper #2: Lehana Thabane from McMaster University in Canada will speak about best practices in mentoring, especially when the mentee is from a developing country. Paper #3: Lisa Bersales from the University of the Philippines will speak about the impacts of mentoring, especially for statisticians in developing countries. Discussant #1: Sally Evans is the fourth member of the ISI’s committee on mentoring. She will discuss the impacts of mentoring in the private sector. Discussant #2: Oliver Chinganya is the co-chair of the ISI’s Capacity Building Committee. He will discuss how mentoring factors into other activities related to capacity building. Matthew Shearing, the other co-chair of the ISI’s Capacity Building Committee will provide his perspective as chair of the session. Mentoring is multifaceted. It involves aspects of coaching, advising, consulting, collaborating, championing, teaching, and learning. What mentoring means to one person will almost surely be different for another person. In all cases, mentoring can be helpful for improving one’s skills—both technical and professional—in statistics and data science. As such, mentoring can be very useful for building the capacity of individuals and thereby building the statistics capacity of the individuals’ organizations.

This session will provide a platform to exchange ideas between pharmaceutical industry experts and academic professionals, which may foster new ideas of research and help boost uptakes of novel designs of clinical trials in practice.     Innovative designs of clinical trials have the advantage of flexibility over traditional designs while maintaining the integrity of the trials. The novel designs could expedite drug development or have ethical benefits for the trial participants. These novel designs use the cumulated information collected during the trials to sequentially make changes to the Alpha spending function or randomization probabilities or other aspects of the designs to improve the efficiency of the designs or to benefit trial participants. However, the uptakes of innovative designs in practice are not as broad as the traditional designs. One of the hesitations in adopting those designs is the concern about the validity of statistical conclusions for the design and the possible loss of efficiency due to the modification of the trials. The modification of a trial proposes challenges to the estimation of treatment effects and in the control of the possible inflation of type I error rate. It is important to have valid statistical inferential methods established for the designs to ensure the inferential properties and efficiency of the designs probably by integrating the inferential properties of treatment effect estimate with design features. The aim of this invited session is to create an opportunity for the front runners in innovative designs of clinical trials to exchange ideas and disseminate research findings. This session invites five experts in the topic area to talk about and discuss their cutting-edge research findings on innovative designs and statistical inference for clinical trials.

The analysis and elaboration of these kinds of data require the use of data science methods and tools besides “traditional” statistical methods. The applications of data science tools range from earth observation to official statistics, and the discussion on advantages, disadvantages, limitations, and requirements of the use of alternative data sources integrated with probability sample surveys is informing the debate in national and international statistical systems all over the world. This Invited Paper Session (IPS) focuses on most relevant methodological and applied issues of data science: interpretability of machine learning tools, potential bias, integration of new data sources with sample surveys for improving official statistics, analysis of huge amounts of meteorological and remote sensing data. This IPS is proposed by the vice-chair and chair-elect of the ISI Special Interest Group on Data Science, discusses methodological and applied issues, and is balanced from geographical and gender point of view. Tree-based statistical learning techniques and explicative tools Speaker: Rosanna Verde, Professor of Statistics - Università della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli""​, Italy Abstract. Machine Learning tools are very popular in the field of supervised classification when the number of observations and the number of variables is too large to predict a priori classes. However, there is a strong automatism in the classification process which represents a challenge of the widely consolidated techniques. An interesting contribution could certainly be to provide interpretative and descriptive tools, which in addition to the accuracy of the prediction, allow us to understand the discriminating power of the selected descriptors as the most competing in the construction of trees. For this reason, a criterion of recognition of the predictors that most contribute to the separation of the a priori groups, should be combined with an embedding procedure that seeks multiple solutions and a final compromise. Aids to the interpretation of the tree-based functional classifiers is still an open frontier. Some contributions are advanced in the choice of the best transformation of functional data to grasp the differences between the classes to be predicted in terms of slope or changing rates. Applications on real data, in the medical and environmental fields, allow to validate the proposals, related to the interpretative tools in the classification methods based on trees.

Evolving Official Statistics: The Increasingly Varied Role of Data Science Speaker: Linda J. Young, Chief Mathematical Statistician and Director Research and Development Division, USDA NASS Abstract. Sample surveys have been the foundation of official statistics produced by the US Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and other National Statistical Institutes for more than half a century. Increasingly, information from diverse sources, such as administrative, weather, and remotely sensed data, is available and can be used to improve fully survey-based estimates. In addition, new products that inform official statistics can be developed, such as new metrics or maps of the scope and intensity of natural disasters. In this presentation, data science approaches that are being used in the production of official statistics are highlighted. Estimates of the propensity of response from a sampled unit have been incorporated in the sampling and data collection phases of surveys.

Spatio-temporal modelling of the Brazilian wildfires: The influence of human and meteorological variables Speaker: Paulo Canas Rodrigues, Department of Statistics, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, BA, Brazil Abstract: Wildfires are one of the most common natural disasters in many world regions and actively impact life quality. These events have become frequent with the increasing effect of climate change and other local policies and human behaviour. This study considers the historical data with the geographical locations of all the ``fire spots'' detected by the reference satellites that cover the whole Brazilian territory between January 2011 and December 2020, comprising more than 1.8 million fire spots. This data was modelled with a spatial econometric model using meteorological variables (precipitation, air temperature, humidity, and wind speed) and a human variable (land-use transition and occupation) as covariates. We find that the change in land use from forest and green areas to farming has a significant positive impact on the number of fire spots for all six Brazilian biomes.

                 Mr Tashi Dorjee ","Improving quality of administrative data for statistical purposes Administrative data collected by governments and service providers in the course of their day-to-day business is an increasingly important source for the production of official statistics to fill gaps in the data available to policy and decision makers to monitor progress and implement the 2030 Agenda and other government priority areas.  How to proceed to get access to administrative data sources and how to assess and assure the quality of these data for statistics production are, however, challenges that many countries are facing and seek guidance and experience from others on. To respond to these and other related needs, the UN Statistics Division and the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data established the Collaborative on Administrative Data for Statistical Purposes in 2020. From early on it was agreed with the various members, representing national statistical offices, regional and international agencies, to have a practically oriented focus. This included sharing of resources, tools, best practices and experiences, and contributing to raising awareness among all members of national statistical systems about the benefits of sharing and combining administrative sources to enhance the quality, timeliness, coverage and level of disaggregation of statistical data. Members of the Collaborative on administrative data have now started work on the development of quality assessment and assurance guidance documents that focus on administrative data. As the need for guidance is strong among low resource countries that are just initiating their efforts to make better use of administrative data sources, the focus has initially been on this context, but experiences from further advanced countries are also brought together through various fora of exchange such as the inventory of resources of the Collaborative and expert clinics. In parallel, the Expert Group on National Quality Assurance Frameworks (EG-NQAF) is considering providing additional guidance regarding quality assurance in the case of administrative and other data sources.. The work of the two groups is coordinated through UN Statistics Division and is expected to bring consolidated practical level guidance resources on quality in administrative data for statistical purposes to the UN Statistical Commission in the coming years. This session will present some of these ongoing efforts on ensuring quality in administrative data sources for statistics production, showcasing good practices from countries, covering different levels of development and use of administrative data sources. Recent practically oriented tools that are meant to support countries in their work to operationalize quality assurance work on administrative data will also be presented. The session will be moderated by UN Statistics Division (Ms. Vibeke O Nielsen) and include presentations as follows: - Presentation on practical tool/guidance material on assessing quality of administrative data for statistical purposes, targeted towards countries that are in early stages of the work (Ms. Silja Emmel, consultant working for the Collaborative on administrative data/UN Women) - The experience of quality assessment and assurance of administrative data in Dominican Republic (Ms. Miosotis Rivas, Director General, National Statistics Office, Dominican Republic) - Assessing the quality of administrative data in Bhutan (Mr. Phub Sangay, Specialist III, National Statistics Bureau, Bhutan) - Engagement with administrative data owners on data quality in Poland (Mr. Janusz Dygaszewicz, Director of ICT Systems, Geostatistics and Census Department, Statistics Poland) - Discussant: Ms. Lucia Barbone, Team Leader of data quality and analysis, Office of National Statistics, United Kingdom - Q&A/discussion - Conclusion Organiser:Vibeke Nielsen  Chair:Vibeke Nielsen  Speaker:Tashi Dorjee  Speaker:Silja Emmel  Speaker:Miosotis Rivas  Speaker:Janusz Dygaszewicz ",https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/session/340/details/

The pandemic, the war in Ukraine, but also countless other armed conflicts or a smaller-scale of epidemics constitute a great challenge for the systems of official statistics. The economic effects of the pandemic cannot be overestimated, a massive impact on global supply chains, issues of raw material and commodity security, restrictions in the workplace and interpersonal contacts, a complete halt to selected sectors of the economy, or the rapidly growing public debts of countries, are just some of the effects of the still unfinished pandemic. As if that was not enough, the acute refugee crisis in Europe, with the massive blow to the affected economies, the blockage of air routes and the Black Sea ports, and the collapse of fuel imports and exports of agricultural products have further disruptive effects on a national and global economy. The session aims to discuss these issues that charge official statistics with new tasks and challenges. We wish to demonstrate the contribution of statistics to such knowledge not only by recording the horrors of the war but also by providing statistical evidence on cross-border and transnational human solidarity and empathy, as well as the concern for the shared values of all societies which want to live in peace. Not only through a simple listing of subsequent activities and changes introduced in connection with the course of the pandemic but also an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms necessary to establish the tools that will ensure the sustainable use of the experience gained in the future. The session is devoted to statistical data production during times of great hardship. It will bring together speakers from the national statistical offices, academia, and international organizations. We will encourage an open exchange of views and discussions on, but not limited to, the following topics: -production of official statistics in pandemic conditions, agility in adapting to changing conditions, and ability to respond quickly to new information needs; -war conditions and on the role of official statistics in documenting the effects of aggression on the economy and society with the emphasis on statistical sytems of countries affected by war; -Issues relating to the humanitarian crisis and the degradation of people’s well-being; -reconstruction and strengthening of national statistical systems, with particular focus on development aid for Ukraine including support to the NSS; -the issues of ensuring efficient coordination of development aid.

Administrative data, organic data and data from web-scraping can overcome these issues, not by themselves but with combination with smaller surveys. Currently, this is an area of enormous interest as survey organizations thrive to reduce cost and improve precision. In this invited session, renowned researchers (from different geographic regions and ethnicity) will share the latest advances developed in this field. Therefore, this invited session can attract a relatively large number of attendees at the 2023 Ottawa Conference.
  There are three presenters and one discussant.  The presenters are Dr. Balgobin Nandram (Worcester Polytechnic Institute, USA), Dr. Serena Arima (Università del Salento, Italy), Dr. Yajuan Si (University of Michigan, USA), and the discussant is Dr. J.N.K. Rao (Carleton University, Canada). The speakers are renowned researchers in the filed of survey sampling. The speakers have carefully been selected to also represent different geographic regions and also diversity based on the ISI mission (equity, diversity, inclusion). Each speaker will talk on a different aspect of data (e.g., administrative, survey) integration, and Dr. Rao will summarize the talks with giving some suggestions/comments and directions for further research in this field.  In particular, Dr. Nandram will talk on Bayesian data integration for predictive inference about small areas where a relatively small probability sample and a non-probability sample are available from each area. He will show that the data-integrated model provides small area estimates, mostly similar to those of the probability sample only model, but with larger precision. Dr. Arima will talk on modeling of misreported data which come from combination of registry and survey data. The aim is to develop statistical tools for analyzing misreported data, a problem that frequently occurs when dealing with social science data, note that misreporting is typically treated as a nuisance factor to be removed from the analysis with ex-post correction methods, rather than to be considered as a structural component in the model specification. Dr. Si will talk on sampling design for multiple surveys. The aim is to develop strategies for a coordinated sampling process to potentially reduce burdens on decision-makers and respondents, decrease refusal/nonresponse, and exploit the variables collected across surveys to leverage data from multiple surveys.

These critical skills constitute a significant missing gap and a major hindrance to the growth and development of capacity in statistical collaboration. Statistical collaboration with domain expert proposal is an initiative in bridging this gap across higher education institutions/industries in Africa and other parts of the world. Researchers collaborating with statisticians for their inputs are gaining popularity on a daily basis. Several researchers have good expertise in their field, but lack prerequisite statistical knowledge for both  methodological and the analysis section in their works. The solution to this is collaboration and creation of synergy between statisticians and domain experts. This IPS session is expected to focus on the skills/techniques for improving statistical collaboration with special focus on domain experts in medicine, agriculture, economics, education, environmental sciences, biological and physical sciences. This session will bring together four speakers/domain experts from four different institutions and countries in Africa to speak about statistical collaboration with domain experts in their respective institutions/countries.                                                                                                                      Justification: Statistical collaboration is educational, exciting and challenging. The technique provide the means to keep statistical and communication skills sharp and also provides the opportunity to discover different and potentially better ways to explain things. Collaboration between domain experts and industries is becoming increasingly beneficial and brings great rewards that are also distinct in developing countries. Some of the benefits are to avoid duplication, exploit synergies complementary of scientific-technological capabilities, foster communication of public outcomes and boost mobility of labour between public and private sectors. Statistical collaboration is a convenient way to expand your professional network beyond statistics and data science. The growth phenomenon is visible in the global demand for statisticians as well as in the production of statistics graduates. The statistical collaboration is for building capacity to improve informal statistical skills through training and collaboration with domain experts to bridge the gap. The purpose plan is to draw out lessons that are unique and common from different domain experts across the continents, regions, countries and institutions. Focusing in Africa is essential as the gap between the supply and demand is believed to be wider when compared with the rest of the world. This session will be of interest to a wide range of stakeholders, including prospective applicants, sponsors, governing bodies of institutions, statistical agencies, scholarship awarding individuals and organizations, who will be attending the World Statistics Congress (WSC). Finally statistical collaboration with domain expert discussion and knowledge sharing from the speakers can be helpful to other professions.

                 Lorenzo Mercuri ","Thanks to the ever-advancing information-processing horsepower, a broad spectrum of large-scale and high-frequency data with complex spatiotemporal dependent structures have become available. Stochastic processes serve as essential tools for modeling such data. Importantly, most of them involve non-Gaussian characters often caused by jumps with various types of intensities and/or state-dependent structures. To create and deal with such models in an efficient manner, it is urgent and imperative to develop statistical methodologies based on both advanced mathematical statistics and stochastic analyses for stochastic processes. Simple combinations and/or adaptations of the currently available models and statistics are not enough, and associated bodies of theories are yet to be developed. Our session is intended to present the state-of-the-art of this quite active area of research. Specifically, our objectives include general Lévy-driven stochastic processes and various kinds of models driven by a Hawkes-type self-exciting point process, featuring how to statistically manage various kinds of non-Gaussianity to be able to deal with the above-mentioned dependent data in theoretically rigorous yet practical and transparent manners. Our session consists of four specialists. Arnaud Gloter from France (Université d'Évry Val d'Essonne) is an expert in statistics for stochastic processes with jumps having complicated dependence and self-exciting structure. The topic has recently been highlighted as a new direction of research on financial large-scale data, neurosciences, and earthquake-prediction analysis, to mention just a few. His recent contributions include several contemporary cornerstones not only in mathematical statistics but also in stochastic calculus of jump processes. Hiroki Masuda from Japan (The University of Tokyo) specializes in statistics for Lévy-driven models. His recent research objectives include quasi-likelihood analyses of Gaussian and non-Gaussian types and their complementary properties and robustification, regularized estimation of both sparse and non-sparse types, and information criteria. He is primarily interested in constructing statistical methods that well balance theory and computation in practice through creating easy-to-use statistics. Lorenzo Mercuri from Italy (University of Milan) is an active researcher with expertise in not only statistical modeling for a general class of point-process regressions but also in building efficient numerical algorithms and software development. Recently, he is working on several CARMA-type models, along with developing some tractable multivariate non-Gaussian distributions, partly called mixed tempered stable. Further, he is a core developer of the YUIMA R package designed for simulation and statistics of various kinds of stochastic processes. Ioane Muni Toke from France (CentraleSupélec, chair of Quantitative Finance) is an expert in quantitative finance. He has proposed many statistical methods for modeling order flows in limit order books based on marked point process type and developed related quasi-likelihood analysis. Through extensive real data analyses, he recently proved some causality phenomena when one applies Hawkes type process to financial market data and clarified the importance of statistical model assessment. With the above-mentioned backgrounds, all the talks in our session provide us with advanced contemporary machinery from not only theoretical but also computational points of view. They are closely connected in the field of mathematical statistics for stochastic processes, and a large amount of synergistic development can be expected through information sharing. They should serve as solid theoretical and computational foundations for future developments in related directions. Arnaud Gloter will present nonparametric inference of the coefficients of a self-exciting jump-diffusion process based on high-frequency observations over a long-time horizon. The proposed inference procedure consists of three steps: first, the volatility coefficient is estimated over an appropriate linear subspace through a smoothed truncation methodology. A theoretical bound for the empirical risk is obtained, making a regularity-based adaptive estimation possible subsequently. Second, an estimator of a sum between the volatility and the coefficient of self-exciting jumps is obtained through the conditional expectation of the jump intensity. Therein, an oracle inequality for an adaptive estimator is obtained. Finally, a methodology is given to recover the jump-component function. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to measure the accuracy of the proposed estimators in practice. Hiroki Masuda will talk about the noise-inference problem for non-Gaussian Lévy-driven stochastic differential equation (SDE). By making extensive use of appropriate quasi-likelihood functions, a stochastic expansion for the unit-time residuals functionals is derived. The results reveal the quantitative effect of plugging in the estimators of the coefficients, paving a flexible way toward practical and theoretically validated inference procedures for the driving-noise characteristics. In addition, we will also present a combined usage of the different quasi-likelihoods for asymptotically efficient inference with bypassing heavy numerical optimization and show how one can robustify the quasi-likelihood against jumps and/or outliers in a simple manner. Further, we demonstrate the implementation of the theoretical results on computers. Lorenzo Mercuri will present the novel use of CARMA(p,q) models for the intensity of point processes. Point processes are vital to describe the dynamics of observed event times. A standard Hawkes model with an exponential kernel entails a strictly decreasing behavior of the autocorrelation function. However, the monotonicity assumption on the autocorrelation function is often empirically rejected. To reproduce more realistic dependence structures, he will introduce a generalization of the Hawkes process, called CARMA(p,q)-Hawkes process, by incorporating a CARMA(p,q) model for the intensity. In that framework, an estimation procedure based on the distance between theoretical and empirical autocorrelation functions is given together with its asymptotic properties. Ioane Muni Toke will talk about Markov-switching Hawkes processes with applications to modeling financial microstructure. He built a multidimensional point process with Hawkes intensities through a hidden Markov chain. Estimation of both process intensities and state transition probabilities is carried out using an EM algorithm, and an alternative Bayesian approach is also provided. In-depth numerical and computational analyses of the performances of the estimation algorithms are presented. The results extend and improve previous modeling propositions developed in more restricted frameworks, for example with restricted excitation kernels. The model is applied to analyze equity and cryptocurrency market data, and it turns out to be an efficient tool to retrieve financially interpretable market states described by different intensity regimes.

Massive data sets from disparate sources ranging from social networks to census data are frequently used to understand how pre-existing conditions and social disparities might undermine population responses to environmental changes in rural and urban areas, compromising health conditions and timely responses to complex environmental stressors. Professor Grace Chiu from Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), Professor Veronica Berrocal from the University of California in Irvine and Monica Pirani from Imperial College in London have approached several issues in the frontiers of data science, health, and environment. Grace Chiu is founder and director of the Environmental Statistics and Transdisciplinary Data Science Lab at VIMS. She develops integrative, holistic statistical methodologies for multi-faceted problems, stemming mainly from the environmental sciences. She will present the work “Latent-causal socio-economic health index“ using an integrative modelling approach for identifying important drivers of societal health at a the global scale (joint work with FS Kuh and AH Westveld). Professor Veronica Berrocal is an Associate Professor at the University of California in Irvine. Professor Berrocal’s research focuses on developing statistical models that extract information from data collected over space and time, including approaches to obtain spatially detailed, actionable measures of a neighborhood’s health behaviors. She will talk about “Modeling and inferring upon the effect of built environment features on children’s health outcomes”. Professor Monica Pirani is a Lecturer in Biostatistics at Imperial College London. Professor Pirani’s research is based upon the development of statistical methods driven by real-world applications, at the intersection of environment, changes in climate and population health. Her talk will be about “Climate and environmental drivers of spatio-temporal spread of arboviruses”. These talks attempt to provide different angles on the intersection between data science, health, and the environment.

 20 July 2023,Thursday,14:00,15:40,IPS 211 - The Role of Statistics in Nation-Building,IPS Room 212,Category: IPS,Statistics and Birth of a Nation, Mr Jean-Louis Bodin ,"This session, created by the ISI Committee on the History of Statistics, illustrates the important role statistical systems play during the creation of new nations. Margo Anderson will discuss the history of the U.S. Census in the context of the development of the Constitution of the United States and the birth of that nation. Then, Jean-Louis Bodin will use four examples -- Belgium, Poland, Palestine, and the European Union -- to illustrate the importance of statistical systems across multiple nations and multi-nation entities. Stephen Stigler, an expert on the history of statistics, and Dan Bouk, expert on the U.S. Census and author of Democracy's Data: The Hidden Stories in the US Census and How to Read Them, will serve as discussants for the session. The session is an important look at how democratic systems are reliant on and scaffolded by statistical systems.   For Margo Anderson: Statistics and Nation Building: The American Case The discipline of statistics, official statistical systems, and representative democracy grew up together, so to speak. The paper will treat the American case. In the 18th century, the victorious colonists resorted to census taking and public fiscal record keeping as solutions to some of the problems they faced constructing a stable state structure after the American revolution.  The “framers,” as they are called, wrote a decennial census into Article 1 of the new Constitution, as a mechanism for assessing the tax responsibilities of and allocating political power among the disparate former colonies, now “states” in the “United States.” They also required a public federal public, and for the President to make a “periodic” – now annual – report to the Congress on the “state of the union” [Article 2].  What we now call the “federal statistical system” has been a function of the American state ever since.  The paper will explore this history and the implications of what we would call today “data” for understanding and managing democracy and political conflict ever since, and how that grounding also shaped the discipline of statistics. For Jean-Louis Bodin: Many nations suddenly came into being at some point in history when they did not exist before or had not existed for some time. It can be difficult to prove in the eyes of the international community that they really exist and that their creation rests on a solid foundation. Very often in these cases, statisticians play a very important role: the production of a large and coherent statistical compendium for these new nations was clearly the proof of the existence of these newly created nations; the statistical system put in place allows the new administrations to achieve their objectives in an efficient and rational way. This presentation will illustrate, through famous historical examples from 1830 to the present day, the fundamental role played by statistics during the emergence of new nations or supranational institutions and its importance for the processes of ‘nation building’. When creating these new political decision-making spaces, the need to govern based on reliable, objective, relevant and transparent economic, social and environmental data appears, thus demonstrating the need and interest for governance by data.

                 Prof. Tatyana Krivobokova ","Today, Mixed Effects Models (MEM) are extremely popular in many statistical domains for their success in prediction, data adaptiveness and experimental designs. As therefore they have been studied by a broadly composed scientific community, to the mentioned three adds the advantage of ‘being well studied and understood’. The first mentioned advantage (prediction power) is the main reason why they have become standard in Small Area Estimation (SEA). However, along with the increasing use in practice come new challenges like when using SAE predictors for comparative statistics or when combining standard approaches with model selection and highly nonlinear methods, often summarized as machine learning procedures. It is quite easy to show and see that the classical and therefore commonly used methods fail to work or get misinterpreted in what they actually offer to its user. As a simple example, none of the so far existing methods for constructing prediction intervals for SAE parameters was made for post-selection inference although model selection is typically applied in practice. They are neither made for doing comparative analysis between small areas, but SAE-based resource-allocation implies exactly this, what partly explains the existence of rank-estimates for small area parameters. Focusing on particularly poor or polluted small areas requires conditional inference, a topic that so far has largely been ignored. More complex data structures require highly nonlinear methods like random forests that also allow for the inclusion of qualitative data. Etc. This session presents recent advances to attack the statistical problems that arise from exactly those examples, namely uniform, conditional, post-selection and random forest inference for SAE predictors.   The already confirmed 3 speakers/authors will be Prof. Tatyana Krivobokova, University of Vienna, Austria, https://sme.univie.ac.at/tatyana-krivobokova will talk about her research on conditional and post-LASSO inference in mixed models with examples in SAE, partly already publishes e.g. in JASA Prof. Nikos Tzavidis, University of Southampton, UK, https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wzwrv/professor-nikos-tzavidis will present his research on doing inference with Mixed Effects Random Forests Prof. Stefan Sperlich, University of Geneva, Switzerland, https://sites.google.com/view/stefansperlich will talk about uniform inference in SAE and model selection for mixed parameters. As discussant we invited (and he already confirmed): Dr. David Newhouse, Senior Economist at the World Bank, https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/people/d/david-newhouse will discuss these presentations from the practitioners’ point(s) of view. The session is jointly proposed and organized by Nikos Tzavidis and Stefan Sperlich. As outlined in the description, we focus on recent advances in complex inference for Mixed Effects Models (MEM) as these are extremely popular in many statistical domains. In this session we concentrate on new challenges for using MEM for small area estimation (SAE, where ""small areas"" may refer to any kind of clusters, not necessarily geographical ones), a statistics domain in which MEMs are particularly popular due to their prediction power.  
More specifically, we consider inference problems that arise when using MEM for small area predictors (a) to do comparative or joint statistics for various or all areas simultaneously, (b) when looking at estimates resulting from model selection, or (c) predictors resulting from highly nonlinear methods like random forests with mixed effects. It is easy to see that the existing classic, commonly used methods fail to work then, or at least don't offer what the practitioner expects them to do. Examples are that e.g. classical prediction intervals for SAE parameters were not made for any of the above problems: not for uniform or simultaneous infernce, not for post-selection inference, not for highly non-linear predictors. They are neither made for doing comparative analysis between small areas, but SAE-based resource-allocation implies exactly this. Morever, focusing on particularly poor or polluted small areas requires joint conditional inference, a topic that so far has largely been ignored. Likelwise, more complex data structures require highly nonlinear methods like random forests that would in addition allow for the inclusion of qualitative data.
Over the last four to five years, the invited speakers have been working exactly on these particular inference problems, i.e. uniform, post-selection, conditional, and highly non-linear inference for MEM. This session is intended to give an overview of the recent advances of such complex inference problems that practitioners are more and more frequently facing in small area estimation (in particular in official and environmental statistics, and especially for the new requirements of providing SDG-indicators on highly disaggregated levels).
Prof Tatyana Krivobokova will talk about her findings on conditional and post-LASSO inference in mixed models, Prof. Nikos Tzavidis will present his research on doing inference with mixed effects Random Forests, and Prof. Stefan Sperlich will talk about uniform and simultaneous inference for SAE. Dr. David Newhouse, Senior Economist at the World Bank, will discuss these advances from the practitioners’ point(s) of view, and Prof. Monica Pratesi, an internationally expert for small area estimation in practice and theory, acts as Session Chair.

Indeed, policy makers and citizens have been asking for more and more data to understand and monitor the development of the 2030 Agenda, the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. However, nowadays, attention spans are extremely short and facts are now competing with attractive fake news. So how can data producers innovate to share high-quality and reliable data to the general public? Which tools can be used to catch the information of citizens and provide the information that might help them in their day-to-day life? What do citizens need from official statistics? This session organized is organized within the framework of the “Unlocking the Power of Data Initiative”, a project launched by the Swiss Confederation to expand the dialogue on data and statistics to stakeholders beyond the data and statistics communities and deepen knowledge. It will be the fourth event of the Data Literacy Workstream, following its launch at the UNWDF 2023, a side-event at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development and a recent event in Tirana, Albania. Whereas previous events have focused on getting policy makers on board with the data agenda, this event will target the general public. It will seek to find good practices to reach and interest citizens in data by showing them how data can be useful in their day-to-day life. This session will bring two data producers to share their good practices in reaching out to the general public and two data users, one from the Parliament and from policymaking to share what is needed from their side and what is attractive to the public.

                SL
                 Dr Suyu Liu ","Targeted therapies and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment of cancers. These novel therapies demonstrate unique characteristics and challenges that cannot be handled well by existing trial designs developed for conventional chemotherapies. For example, increasing doses of targeted therapies and immunotherapies beyond a certain level may not enhance antitumor activity; treatment effects are often delayed and heterogeneous; and targeted therapies and immunotherapies are often combined with standard chemotherapies. In this session, we invited four experts to present recent developments on Bayesian adaptive designs to address these challenges. Specifically, Dr. Yong Zang (Indiana University) will present a practice phase I/II clinical trial design to identify optimal biological dose. Dr. Suyu Liu (University of MD Anderson Cancer Center) will introduce a novel Bayesian adaptive design to optimize the combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapy. Dr. Depeng Jiang (University of Manitoba, Canada) will describe a Bayesian adaptive promising zone design for cancer immunotherapy to handle delayed treatment effect and treatment heterogeneity. Dr. Ying Yuan (University of MD Anderson Cancer Center) will discuss these novel methodology, existing challenges and future directions for Bayesian adaptive designs for targeted therapies and immunotherapies.
  Modified isotonic regression based phase I/II clinical trial designs identifying optimal biological dose
Yong Zang
Indiana University
 
Conventional phase I/II clinical trial designs often use complicated parametric models to characterize the dose-response relationships and conduct the trials. However, the parametric models are hard to justify in practice, and the misspecification of parametric models can lead to substantially undesirable performances in phase I/II trials. Moreover, it is difficult for the physicians conducting phase I/II trials to clinically interpret the parameters of these complicated models, and such significant learning costs impede the translation of novel statistical designs into practical trial implementation. To solve these issues, we propose a transparent and efficient phase I/II clinical trial design, referred to as the modified isotonic regression-based design (mISO), to identify the optimal biological doses for molecularly targeted agents and immunotherapy. The mISO design makes no parametric model assumptions on the dose-response relationship and yields desirable performances under any clinically meaningful dose-response curves.  Our comprehensive simulation studies show that the mISO and mISO-B designs are highly efficient in optimal biological dose selection and patients allocation and outperform many existing phase I/II clinical trial designs.  A Bayesian Phase I/II  Trial Design for Cancer clinical Trials Combining Immunotherapy and Chemotherapy
Suyu Liu

Immunotherapy is an innovative treatment approach that harnesses a patient's immune system to treat cancer. It has provided an alternative and complementary treatment modality to conventional chemotherapy. Combining immunotherapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy agent has become the leading trend and the most active research field in oncology. To accommodate this growing trend, we propose a Bayesian phase I/II dose-finding design to identify the optimal biological dose combination (OBDC), defined as the dose combination with the highest desirability in the risk-benefit tradeoff. We propose new statistical models to describe the relationship between the doses and treatment outcomes, including immune response, toxicity, and progression-free survival (PFS). During the trial, based on accrued data, we continuously update model estimates and adaptively assign patients to dose combinations with high desirability. The simulation study shows that our design has desirable operating characteristics.
 
Bayesian adaptive promising zone design for cancer immunotherapy 
Depeng Jiang1
University of Manitoba The indirect mechanism of immunotherapy for cancer might lead to the delay of treatment effect and the delay times are often heterogeneous among patients. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive design with the sample size being adjusted in an interim analysis. We first used the interim data to re-estimate the survival parameters and parameters in the individual delay time distribution. Then we calculated the conditional power and adjusted the sample size based on this conditional power. The results indicate that our proposed promising zone design improved the conditional power remarkably over the existing designs.

The three selected developing countries are Ghana, Nigeria and Pakistan. 
Waste scavenging (WS) is a means of survival in the situation of severe poverty in most developing countries which is a strategic business opportunity especially among marginalized groups if innovatively annexed. Despite the sustainable business potential of WS, it has not translated to economic prosperity for most women involved in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Pakistan. This is due to several militating factors of which very weak ICTs capacities are one of the most important of all the factors negating poor women’s abilities to transform waste to wealth. The study explores the enhancement of ICTs skills/capacities of poor women involved in the WS value-chain to enhance their livelihood sustainably in the selected three developing countries.  Women and girls involved in waste picking (scavenging) are usually breadwinners from marginalized communities. Often, they are criminalized, marginalized, harassed, extorted, stigmatized, and exposed to various health hazards and are always at the bottom of the recycling pyramid. The study explores the effect of building their capacity, to reduce the incidences of middlemen, and to be able to represent and protect themselves which invariably will improve their livelihood and automatically their community.

In this respect, this IPS is particularly of interest to the WSC attendees as it will be showcasing the challenges and prospects the presenter countries face in establishing a solid data ecosystem to meet the emerging data and information needs for the prosperity and well-being of their societies, contributions of the presenters from regional and multilateral organisations concerning the modernisation of official statistical systems for the achievement of global and regional development agenda. The invited presenters are Chief Statisticians of their respective countries (tbc – Malaysia and Palestine) with efforts in transforming their NSSs to become data culture-oriented and Heads of international and regional intergovernmental statistics and multilateral financial institutions (tbc – GCCStat, IsDB, and SESRIC) with a mandate, among others, to coordinate statistical cooperation and conduct statistical activities in their respective regions. Justification of the Session The global statistical community has recognized the need in leveraging the role played by data as it is the basis for evidence-based decision-making processes. In that regard, the official statistics-producing national agencies need to be equipped with a “data culture” as the core objective of collecting, collating, processing, and disseminating data is to reach better decisions. Accordingly, “data culture is decision culture”. However, instilling the data culture is not an easy feat and a never-ending journey as the world and circumstances around us continue uninterruptedly to evolve. The experiences to be shared by the participating NSOs will shed light on their journey for forming the data culture by not only manifesting their commitment to making data the main ingredient for better decisions but also maintaining a continuous, informed conversation with high-level decision-makers in their respective countries. On the other hand, the presentations/interventions of the participating regional and multilateral organizations will enrich this IPS by informing the attendees about their contributions to the efforts of their respective member countries for instilling the data culture.

                 PROF. EM. Richard EMILION ","This session intends to focus on some of the most recent advances in Symbolic Data Analysis also in relation to the developments in inferential and predictable perspectives, with evidence of their applicative contributions in the analysis of symbolic data in the form of distributions and intervals. 
Interval-valued variables have found more and more attention in data analysis since this type of data represents either the uncertainty existing in an error measurement or the natural variability of the data. Currently, methods and algorithms which aim to manage interval-valued data are very much required to analyse great amount of aggregated data.  
New measure of concordance and discordance represent another new line of research in SDA particularly relevant in SDA to compare a representation of a class of numerical and categorical data to the distribution of the descriptors of a set of classes.
The proposed methods and new proposals are quite all supported by software mainly developed in R. Applications on real data allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the methods.

                 Mr Joost Huurman ","The session will present a series of recent initiatives in the area of data and statistics governance and discuss how they will contribute to strengthen the oversight and/or the integration of data for statistics and evidence-based decision-making.  • European Initiatives to sustainably use new data sources for official statistics, Eurostat, Albrecht Wirthmann, Head of Unit - Methodology and Innovation in Official Statistics • Optimizing the Use of Alternative Data Sources While Maintaining Public Trust : the Role of Data Ethics in National Statistical Offices, Statistics Canada, Martin Beaulieu, Section Chief - Quality and Data Ethics Secretariat  • More integrated governance for data and statistics: the case of the Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO, Valerie Bizier, Senior Statistician - Statistics Governance and Quality Assurance.  The session will be chaired by FAO Chief Statistician, which also one of ISI Council members. The digitalization of our world has increased at unprecedented rate the collection, storage, analysis and use of data by almost everyone, everywhere. This offers great opportunities for statistical advancement. New data sources can improve the quantity and relative quality of statistics produced, which in turn help generate more timely actionable insights and strengthen decision-making. However, this does not come without concomitant risks related, for instance, to data privacy, data integrity and statistics quality, as well as data access and reliance on new data providers. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that the integration of new data sources in statistics production have not yet reached its maturity in terms of underlying methods, skills and governance mechanisms.  How can this situation be best govern so that the benefits of this data (r)evolution largely overcome and address its underlying risks for statistics?  First, what we call “official statistics” need to adapt to this new paradigm to remain relevant. Statistical organizations’ role, capacity and expertise within the broader data sphere needs to be reinforced. For instance, this requires improved regulations and governance mechanisms to enable the access and use of non-traditional data sources by statistical organizations. In particular, the fact that many national statistics legislations have no or very limited provisions for the access of big data and/or Privately-held data for the generation of statistics needs to be addressed.  Second, better governance mechanisms are needed to exercise an adequate control over the use of these new data sources for statistics from the quality, data ethics and data privacy perspective. Indeed, the use of new data sources brings new challenges in these areas and failing to exercise appropriate control or manage those risks could severely damage statistical organizations’ reputation.   Finally, mechanisms are necessary to accelerate the advancement of new methods and tools as well as the development of adequate skills for the integration of alternative data sources for statistical purpose. In particular, investigating and consolidating the use of new data sources requires a much broader set of skills (e.g. data science, GIS and IT-computing) which are rather scarce in most statistical organizations and need to be managed strategically.  Several statistical organizations have however already taken steps towards these objectives and new practices are currently emerging. During this session, experts from a selected number of national, regional and international statistical organizations will discuss recent advancements made in the area of data and statistics governance with the aims to better harness the opportunities but also reduce the risks underlying the rapid growth of data being generated globally and the expansion of data ecosystem to a rising number of actors.

                 Prof. Meredith Rocchi ","Description This session aims to promote shifting the focus of statistics instruction for non-majors towards more wholistic data literacy outcomes. Case studies, lessons learned, and measurement tools that can serve the field will be presented. Technological developments have led to the creation of unprecedented amounts of data, and a cultural shift whereby decisions are almost exclusively data driven. Whether conducting interviews, working with organizational performance indicators, tracking social media behaviour, or reading charts and dashboards, individuals working in fields such as marketing, politics, healthcare, and program evaluation are interacting with exponentially more data and data-based products than ever before. Data literacy is the ability to interpret, critically evaluate, and communicate the statistical-, text-, and probability-based information that emerges in a data-driven society. It requires knowledge of statistics, but also elements of data science, information science, and beyond. Currently, formal training in statistics courses focuses primarily on the mathematical processes and underlying statistical analyses, leaving many students – especially non-majors – overwhelmed and without the understanding of core concepts necessary for identifying good and bad representations of data, converting this knowledge into action, and succeeding in their future careers. To better prepare the current generation of workers for the job market and to help promote productive citizenship, higher education statistics instruction should shift focus towards data literacy outcomes. The speakers will present research results examining the current prevalence of data literacy in higher education, as well as collaborative projects and design principles for revised courses aiming to promote data literacy outcomes. Perspectives from multiple stakeholders including students, professors, and employers obtained using a variety of cross-sectional and longitudinal research designs will be shared. These results will highlight the low rates of data literacy outcomes for students, lack of preparedness for the job market, challenges in current statistics courses, and opportunities for improvements moving forward. The session will conclude with a critical overview of implications for curriculum and training development, as well as key challenges and future directions, and a general discussion.   Justification Much of the current statistical education focuses on providing students with the skills to collect and analyze data while emphasizing rote memorization and mathematical computations instead of interpreting and applying results in the real world. As a result, these courses have a bad reputation among non-majors (i.e., students who are not specializing in statistics or math-focused courses) as they are perceived as irrelevant, anxiety-inducing, unnecessarily challenging, and too focused on performing statistical analyses. Instead, the session will present innovative ideas and findings from formative research about revised courses that adopt a data literacy approach. Such courses emphasize acquiring the skills and tools necessary to become expert consumers and users of data, but not producers and analysts, thus better providing them with the tools to succeed on the job market.  The proposed session is designed to attract attendees from several Associations, including the International Association for Statistical Education (IASE) and the International Society for Business and Industrial Statistics (ISBIS) who are interested in modernizing and adapting a data literacy perspective to statistical education in order to provide non-specialists, and business-oriented students, with the skills required to consume and communicate data in their careers. The proposed presentations will be of particular interest to individuals involved in statistics and data science education, as well as policymakers, public servants, and media who are interested in improving the data literacy skills of citizens-at-large and workers. It may also attract those involved in developing data literacy within the Canadian Federal Government. The speakers were chosen to represent diverse disciplinary perspectives and nationalities in order to approach the topic from multiple perspectives and have actively collaborated on a number of projects since 2020. They are experts in statistics education; measurement; and motivation. The discussants will offer a critical commentary on the described directions, with a focus on the importance of developing skills for consumers of data.  This session aims to promote shifting the focus of statistics instruction for non-majors towards more wholistic data literacy outcomes.

A hidden assumption behind these factorial designs is that the effect on the order of factor inputs is generally negligible, but it may not be true for all real-world scenarios, like the drug intakes in clinical trials. In order to incorporate order effects in experimental analyses, the order-of-addition (OofA) experiments has recently resurfaced among researchers in the design and analysis of experiments. This class of experiment aims to investigate how the different orders of factor inputs (e.g. medicine intakes) provide significant effects towards the response value, so that one can obtain the optimal order of factor inputs. This order-matter concept is useful not only in clinical trials but also in biochemistry, culinary, cosmetic industry, agriculture, and many industrial processes. The optimization of these factorial order effects leads to the best possible use of experimental resources. In this session, we gather leading experts to discuss the recent advances in the research of OofA experimental designs. Each of them introduce their own advancement to the design and analysis of OofA experiment in their presentation, so audiences can learn the design construction, design analysis, and its implementation to specific scientific problems from this session.

 20 July 2023,Thursday,14:00,15:40,IPS 45 - New Directions for the ISI,IPS Room 209,Category: IPS,,,"The ISI is an established statistical society, with long history and many traditions. The WSC is the flagship event, but there is a need to be more innovative. What direction to follow to ensure that the ISI remains relevant in future? In this session we will examine which strategic directions ISI can take to be a relevant and current statistical society. The current strategic directions of the ISI are: 1. Encourage statistical communication and networking; 2. Increase the public voice of statistics; 3. Develop statistical capacity; 4. Secure our financial sustainability. ISIs main objective is reaching out to the members and connecting them by disseminating relevant information and providing platforms to interact with each other. The World Statistics Congress is the flagship event and we all agree that it is indeed an outstanding and unsurpassed event and ISI will continue to host it in the future. During the Covid lockdowns, new features were developed that were highly appreciated by members, such as the ISI and Associations webinar series and short courses. ISIs publications, the International Statistical Review and Stat, still score well and are sought after by authors. The ISI is also respected for being the voice of statistics. ISI has been valued as the voice of statistics and the opinions it publishes. Over the years the ISI has organized seminars and workshops in developing countries and conducted activities to support statisticians from developing countries. Awards and prizes complete the picture. How will we develop the ISI from here? What innovations do we need to attract new and younger members, to remain relevant as a statistical society. What do our members expect from us, who are our strategic partners? The ISI covers broad areas of statistics, from official statistics to theoretic and more. Is it necessary to differentiate more the different blood groups or to find new ways to bring them together? How will new technological developments and artificial intelligence influence our activities and ways we work together? Many questions and therefore we have brought together an exquisite panel of people that should have a vision in this matter. They have been asked to prepare their vision on a couple of questions: 1. What gap do you see in ISI's current strategy and activity program and how can it be filled or developed? 2. Which innovations or developments that you see have consequences for the work of ISI? 3. Plans are fun, but must be financed. Do you have an idea in this regard? 4. What tools can we offer our members to feel connected to society? The panelists are first given 10 minutes to introduce themselves and make general comments. We will then deal with the questions one by one. After every question the panelists will answer questions from the floor. Chair and organizer:
Ada van Krimpen, The Netherlands, former ISI Director (2009-2022). Ada provided support to the ISI Executive and ISI Community in achieving its objectives. Providing support for the organization of the ISI World Statistics Congress has been key in this job.  Pannelists:
